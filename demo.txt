<space> this book owes its origin to the fact that in the autumn of nineteen twenty one <space> the authorities of manchester college oxford <space> invited me to deliver the inaugural course of a lectureship in religion <space> newly established under the will of the late professor upton <space>
<space> psychology and the life of the spirit <space> two <space> contemplation and suggestion <space>
<space> and achievement <space> in the domain of the spiritual life <space> the material gathered for this purpose has now been added to <space> revised and to some extent re written <space>
<space> rather than the abiding substance of spirituality <space> readers of these pages will find nothing about trances <space> ecstasies and other rare psychic phenomena <space> which sometimes indicate holiness <space> and sometimes only disease <space>
<space> warm gratitude first to the principal and authorities of manchester college <space> who gave me the opportunity of delivering these chapters in their original form <space> and whose unfailing sympathy and kindness so greatly helped me <space>
<space> and a further section suggests some ways in which educationists might promote <space> the up springing of this life in the young <space> finally <space> the last chapter attempts to place the fact of <space> the life of the spirit <space> in its relation to the social order <space>
<space> which justify or are fundamental to the spiritual life <space> and the way in which these experiences may be accommodated <space> to the world view of the modern man <space> and next <space> the nature of that spiritual life as it appears in human history <space>
<space> and to indicate some of the results which might follow <space> upon its healthy corporate development <space> it is superfluous to point out that each of these subjects needs at least a volume to itself <space>
<space> the succeeding sections of the book treat in some detail the light cast on spiritual problems by mental analysis <space> a process which need not necessarily be conducted from the standpoint of <space> a degraded materialism <space>
<space> and no <space> angel <space> since my subject is not the splendor of historic sanctity <space> but the normal life of the spirit <space> as it may be and is lived in the here and now <space>
<space> no conditions being attached to this appointment <space> it seemed a suitable opportunity to discuss <space> so far as possible in the language of the moment <space> some of the implicits which <space> i believe to underlie human effort <space>
<space> or who are <space> offended by the resulting demonstrations of continuity between <space> our most homely and <space> most lofty reactions to the universe <space> might take to themselves the plain words of thomas <space> a kempis <space> thou art a man and not god <space> thou art flesh <space>
<space> no attention has been given to those abnormal experiences and states of consciousness <space> which too often regarded as specially mystical <space> are now recognized by all competent students as representing the unfortunate accidents <space>
<space> and by recent work on the psychology of autistic thought and of suggestion <space> these investigations have a practical interest for <space> every man who desires to be the captain of his soul <space>
<space> and the problems surrounding symbols <space> and cults <space> these chapters lead up to a discussion of the personal aspect of the spiritual life <space> its curve of growth <space> characters and activities <space>
<space> for information on these matters <space> they must go to larger and more technical works <space> my aim here is the more general one <space> of <space> indicating first the characteristic experiences <space> discoverable within all great religions <space>
<space> the relation in which institutional religion does or <space> should stand <space> to the spiritual life <space> is also in part <space> a matter for psychology <space> which is here called upon to deal with the religious aspect of the social instincts <space>
<space> but she refused to let him keep horses for it <space> they were hired for the solemn occasions when she paid morning or evening visits <space> she had had horses for three days not a fortnight before <space>
<space> margaret's manner had an <space> extra tinge of coldness in it <space> when she next spoke <space> you have good concerts here i believe <space>
<space> missus thornton did not speak <space> but she laid her work on the table <space> and seemed to think <space> it will be a long way for her to walk back at night <space>
<space> as missus thornton observed to herself <space> she liked missus hale's double knitting far better <space> that was sensible of its kind <space> the room altogether was full of knick knacks <space> which must take a long time to dust <space> and time to people of limited income <space> was money <space>
<space> he went abruptly out of <space> the room after saying this <space> if he had staid a minute longer <space> fanny would have cried at his tone of command <space> even when he used the words <space> you will oblige me <space>
<space> but <space> surely <space> it is a very easy journey to london <space> yes but somehow said fanny lowering her voice <space> mamma <space> has never been to <space> london herself <space> and can't understand my longing <space>
<space> but so much the more i have to watch over you <space> now <space> as for fanny there <space> a little hardship would do her good <space> she is not made of the same stuff as you are john <space> she could not bear it <space>
<space> as dinner giving and as criticising other people's dinners <space> she took satisfaction in it <space> but this <space> going to make acquaintance with strangers was a <space> very different thing <space>
<space> may i inquire <space> margaret <space> had not the words ready for an answer to this question <space> which <space> took her a little by surprise <space> so miss thornton replied <space>
<space> the last time you were out in a cab <space> you came home with a headache from the jolting <space> i never complained of it i'm sure <space> no <space>
<space> it will do you good instead of harm <space>
<space> fifteen shillings a week and three saved out of <space> them <space> thought margaret to herself <space> but she must have been very young <space> she probably has forgotten her own personal experience <space> but she must know of <space> those days <space>
<space> missus thornton was silent after this <space> for her last <space> words bore relation to a subject which mortified her <space> she had an <space> unconscious contempt <space> for a weak character <space> and fanny was weak in the very points in which her mother and brother were strong <space>
<space> who might now put themselves to trouble and expense in their turn <space> yet crampton was too far off for her to walk <space> and she had repeatedly questioned her son as to whether his <space> wish that she should <space> call on the hales <space> was strong enough to bear the expense of cab hire <space>
<space> chapter twelve <space> morning calls <space> well <space> i suppose we must <space> friends in council <space>
<space> missus thornton was not a woman much given to reasoning <space> her quick <space> judgment and firm resolution served her in good stead of any long arguments <space> and discussions with herself <space> she felt instinctively that nothing could strengthen fanny to endure <space> hardships patiently <space>
<space> as fanny had put it <space> it did seem as if they had been <space> impertinently discussing missus thornton's feelings <space> but she also rose up against that lady's manner of showing that she was offended <space> missus thornton went on after a moment's pause <space>
<space> do you know anything of milton miss hale <space> have you seen any of our factories <space> our magnificent warehouses <space> no <space> said margaret <space> i have not seen anything of that description as yet <space>
<space> too crowded that is the worst <space>
<space> but the little altercation between her son and her daughter <space> did not incline missus thornton more favourably towards <space> these hales <space> her jealous heart <space> repeated her daughter's question <space>
<space> this shame <space> i say <space> betrayed <space> the want of a secure resting place for her affection <space> she never called her son by any name but john <space> love and <space> dear and <space> such like terms were reserved for fanny <space>
which cannot be bought <space> it must have been an <space> heir loom <space> and shows that she had <space> ancestors <space> so the <space> owner of the ancestral lace became worthy of something more than the languid exertion to be agreeable to a visitor <space>
<space> at this point mister thornton came in <space> just before going to the mill <space> mother <space> i need hardly say that <space> if there is any little thing that could serve missus hale as an invalid <space> you will offer it i'm sure <space> if i <space> can find it out i will <space>
<space> with what <space> asked missus thornton <space> her brow slightly contracting <space>
<space> then she felt that by <space> concealing her <space> utter indifference to all such places <space> she was hardly speaking with truth <space> so she went on <space>
<space> which the <space> uneasy tenderness of missus thornton's manner to her daughter <space> the shame with which she thought to hide the poverty of her child in all the grand qualities which she <space> herself possessed unconsciously <space> and which she set so high a value upon in <space> others <space>
<space> fanny <space> don't speak so of your brother <space> he has good reasons of <space> some kind or other <space> or he would not wish us to go <space> make haste and put your things on <space>
<space> mister thornton had had some difficulty <space> in working up his mother to the desired point of civility <space> she did not <space> often make calls <space> and when she did <space> it was in heavy state <space> that she went through her duties <space>
<space> but her heart gave thanks for him <space> day and night <space> and she walked proudly among women for his sake <space> fanny dear <space> i shall have horses to the carriage to day <space> to go and call on <space> these hales <space>
<space> every improvement of machinery is i believe to be seen there <space> in its highest perfection <space> i am so <space> glad <space> you don't like mills and manufactories and all those kind of things <space> said fanny <space> in a half whisper <space>
<space> missus hale was making rather more exertion in her answers <space> captivated by some real old lace which missus thornton wore <space> lace <space> as she afterwards observed to dixon <space> of <space> that <space> old english point which has not been made for this <space> seventy <space> years and <space>
<space> missus thornton <space> was shy <space> it was only of late years that she had had leisure enough in her life to go into society <space> and as society she did not enjoy it <space>
<space> she will do you no good i see <space> the mother looks very ill and <space> seems a nice <space> quiet kind of person <space>
<space> than the serene calm of the countenance of one who led a placid <space> contented life <space> margaret was painfully struck by the worn <space> anxious expression <space> and she went back over the open and avowed circumstances of her father's life <space>
<space> a signal <space> which at one time had often to be repeated before any one was sufficiently alive to the hour of the day to understand what it <space> was <space> and attend to him <space> now mister hale loitered about the garden if the morning was fine <space> and if not <space>
<space> and she <space> was not sorry to <space> think that their meeting and greeting would take place at helstone parsonage <space> rather than during the confusion of the last two or three days in the house in harley street <space> where she herself had had to play the part of figaro <space>
<space> the school <space> and the neighbouring cottages <space> this did good for a time <space> but <space> when the autumn drew on <space> and the weather became more changeable <space> her mother's idea of the unhealthiness of the place increased <space>
<space> the oppression of which could not be relieved by any <space> daily action <space> such as comforting the survivors or <space> teaching at the school <space> in hope of lessening the evils in the generation to come <space> mister hale did not go out among his parishioners as much as usual <space>
<space> perhaps it was not quite a logical deduction from all these premises <space> but <space> it was still missus shaw's characteristic conclusion <space> as she thought over her sister's lot <space>
<space> when she was with her mother <space> her father seemed <space> the best person to apply to for information <space> and <space> when with him <space>
<space> man <space> woman <space> or child <space> in some cottage in the green shade of the forest <space> her out of doors life <space> was <space> perfect <space> her <space> in doors life <space> had its drawbacks <space>
<space> the full account of which margaret had never heard <space> and which now seemed doomed to be buried in sad oblivion <space>
<space> his room was kept exactly as he had left it <space> and was regularly <space> dusted <space> and put into order by dixon <space> missus hale's maid <space> who touched no other part of the household <space> work <space>
<space> of those she had lived with so long <space> oppressed her now <space> with a sad regret <space> for the times that were no more <space> it did not signify what those times had been <space> they were gone <space> never to return <space> margaret's heart felt more heavy <space>
<space> only eight years older than herself <space> with the sweetest temper <space> and that blue black hair one so seldom sees <space> mister hale was one of the most delightful preachers she had <space> ever heard <space> and a perfect model of a parish priest <space>
<space> learned and delighted in using their peculiar words <space> took up her freedom amongst them <space> nursed their babies <space> talked <space> or read with slow distinctness <space> to their <space> old people <space>
<space> but <space> always remembered the day when she had been engaged by lady beresford <space> as ladies maid to sir john's wards <space> the pretty miss beresfords <space> the belles of rutlandshire <space>
<space> that she should have to give up many luxuries <space> which had only been troubles and trammels to her freedom in harley street <space> her keen enjoyment of every sensuous pleasure was balanced finely <space> if not overbalanced <space>
<space> to find the cause for the lines that spoke so plainly <space> of habitual distress <space> and depression <space> poor frederick <space> thought she <space> sighing <space> oh <space> if frederick had <space> but been a clergyman <space> instead of going into the navy <space> and being lost to us all <space>
<space> half confidential shake of the head to the parson <space> who watched him away beyond the sweet briar hedge <space> and past the great arbutus <space> before he turned <space> into the room to begin his day's work <space> with all the signs of a heavy heart <space>
<space> alias her married life <space> she remained with her <space> and was devoted to her interests <space> always considering herself as the <space> good and protecting fairy <space> whose duty it was to <space> baffle the malignant giant <space> mister hale <space>
<space> sometimes amused <space> and questioning <space> at others a little inclined to compare her sister's circumstances of <space> ease and comfort <space> with the narrower means <space> at helstone vicarage <space> on such evenings margaret was apt to stop talking rather abruptly <space>
<space> and was wanted <space> everywhere <space> at one and the same time <space> her mind and body ached now with the recollection of <space> all she had done and said <space> within the last forty eight <space> hours <space> the farewells so hurriedly taken <space> amongst <space> all the other good byes <space>
<space> the fern below them caught <space> all <space> the slanting sunbeams <space> the weather was sultry <space> and broodingly still <space> margaret used to tramp along by her father's side <space> crushing down the fern with a cruel glee <space>
<space> her dear father leaning back asleep in the railway carriage <space> his blue black hair was grey now <space> and lay thinly <space> over his brows <space> the bones of his face were plainly to be seen <space>
<space> before winter fairly set in <space> accordingly <space> she was busy preparing her board one morning <space> when sarah <space> the housemaid <space> threw wide open the drawing room door <space> and announced <space>
<space> so he withdrew <space> while the children were yet young <space> into his library <space> to spend his evenings <space> if he were at home <space> in reading the speculative <space> and metaphysical books which were his delight <space>
<space> full of <space> dimples and glances that spoke of childish gladness <space> and <space> boundless hope in the future <space> it was the latter part of july <space> when margaret returned home <space> the forest trees were all one dark full <space> dusky green <space>
<space> but the <space> evenings <space> were rather difficult <space> to fill up agreeably <space> immediately after tea her father withdrew into his small library <space> and she and her mother <space> were left alone <space> missus hale had never cared much for books <space>
<space> not so pleasant <space> in the latter half of september <space> the autumnal rains and storms came on <space> and margaret was obliged to remain more in the house than she had hitherto done <space>
<space> her mother had been <space> detained <space> at home <space> by a multitude of half reasons <space> none of which <space> anybody fully understood <space> except mister hale <space> who was perfectly aware that all his arguments in favour of a grey satin gown <space>
<space> too plainly for beauty <space> if his features had been less finely cut <space> as it was <space> they had a grace <space> if not a comeliness of their own <space> the face was in repose <space> but it was rather <space> rest after weariness <space>
<space> now there were only the well bound <space> little read english classics <space> which were weeded out of her father's library <space> to fill up the small book shelves in the drawing room <space> thomson's <space> seasons <space> hayley's cowper <space> middleton's cicero <space>
<space> not <space> absolutely based <space> on a knowledge of facts <space> is <space> easily banished for a time by a bright <space> sunny <space> day <space> or some happy <space> outward circumstance <space> and when the brilliant fourteen fine days of october came on <space>
<space> the place and the life she had longed for for years <space> at that time of all times for yearning and longing <space> just before the sharp senses lose their <space> outlines <space> in sleep <space>
<space> and margaret <space> would try to tempt her forth on to the <space> beautiful <space> broad <space> upland sun streaked cloud shadowed common <space> for she <space> was sure that her mother had accustomed herself <space> too much to an in doors life <space> seldom extending her walks beyond the church <space>
<space> and had discouraged her husband very early in their married life <space> in his desire of reading aloud to her <space> while she worked <space> at one time they had tried backgammon as a resource <space> but <space> as mister hale grew to take an increasing interest in his school and his parishioners <space>
<space> this life <space> at least <space> these walks <space> realised <space> all margaret's anticipations <space> she took <space> a pride in her forest <space> its people <space> were her people <space> she made hearty friends with them <space>
<space> if we <space> only lived at the other side of the parish <space> it would be something <space> there we should be <space> almost within <space> walking distance of the stansfields <space> certainly the gormans <space> would be within a walk <space> gormans <space> said margaret <space>
<space> were by far the lightest <space> newest <space> and most amusing <space> the book shelves did not <space> afford <space> much resource <space> margaret told her mother every particular of her london life <space> to all of which missus hale listened with interest <space>
<space> and she had <space> really forgotten <space> all grievances <space> except that of the unhappiness arising from disparity of <space> age in married life <space> on which she could descant <space> by the half hour <space> dearest maria had married the man of her heart <space>
<space> are those the gormans who made their fortunes in trade at southampton <space> oh <space> i'm glad we don't visit them <space> i don't like shoppy people <space> i think we are far better off <space> knowing only <space> cottagers and <space> labourers <space>
<space> carried dainty messes to their sick <space> resolved <space> before long to teach at the school <space> where her father went every day as to an appointed task <space> but <space> she was continually tempted off to go and see some <space> individual friend <space>
<space> was of an <space> ivory smoothness and delicacy <space> if the look on her face was in general <space> too <space> dignified and reserved for one so young <space> now <space> talking to her father <space> it was bright as the morning <space>
<space> and gave the face an <space> undecided <space> expression <space> but he had the same large soft <space> eyes as his daughter <space> eyes which moved slowly and almost grandly round in their orbits <space> and were well veiled by their transparent white <space> eyelids <space>
<space> by her conscious pride in being able to do without them <space> all <space> if need were <space> but the cloud never comes in that quarter of the horizon from which we watch for it <space> there <space> had been slight complaints and <space> passing regrets on her mother's part <space>
<space> which was midway between <space> oldness and newness <space> had proved unavailing <space> and that <space> as he had not the money to equip his wife afresh from top to toe <space> she would not show herself <space> at her only sister's <space> only child's wedding <space>
<space> when margaret had been here before <space> she had brought <space> down with her <space> a <space> great <space> box of books <space> recommended by masters or governess <space> and had found the summer's day all too short to get through the reading she had to do before her return to town <space>
<space> once or twice <space> margaret found herself mechanically counting the repetition of the monotonous sound <space> while she wondered <space> if she might <space> venture to put a question on a subject very near to her heart <space> and <space> ask where frederick was now <space>
<space> and with the soft violence of the west wind behind her <space> as she crossed some heath <space> she seemed to be borne <space> onwards <space> as lightly <space> and <space> easily as the fallen leaf <space> that was wafted along <space> by the autumnal breeze <space>
<space> as she felt it <space> yield under her light foot <space> and send up the fragrance peculiar to it <space> out <space> on the broad commons <space> into the <space> warm scented light <space> seeing multitudes of wild free living creatures <space> revelling in the sunshine <space>
<space> she had learnt drawing with <space> edith <space> and she had sufficiently regretted <space> during the gloom of <space> the bad weather <space> her idle revelling in the beauty of the woodlands while it had yet been fine <space> to make her determined to sketch what she could <space>
<space> i wish <space> i knew all about it <space> i never understood it from <space> aunt shaw <space> i only knew he could not come back to england because of that <space> terrible affair <space> poor dear papa <space> how sad he looks <space>
<space> helstone was at some distance from any neighbours of their own standard of cultivation <space> it <space> is undoubtedly <space> one of the most <space> out of the way places in <space> england <space> said missus hale <space> in one of her plaintive moods <space>
<space> a white chip <space> bonnet <space> oh <space> dozens of things for the wedding <space> and hundreds of things for the house <space> margaret only knew that her mother had not found it <space> convenient to come <space>
<space> chapter two <space> roses <space> and <space> thorns <space> by the soft green light <space> in the woody glade <space> on the banks of moss where thy childhood played <space> by the household tree <space>
<space> he found that the interruptions which arose out of these duties <space> were regarded as hardships <space> by his wife <space> not to be accepted as the natural conditions of his profession <space> but to be regretted <space> and struggled against by her <space> as they severally arose <space>
<space> with the healthy shame of a child <space> she blamed herself for her keenness of sight <space> in perceiving that <space> all was not <space> as it should <space> be <space> there <space> her mother <space> her mother always so kind and <space> tender towards her <space>
<space> no <space> rosebud that could only open just enough to let out a <space> yes <space> and <space> no <space> and <space> an't please you sir <space> but the wide mouth was one soft curve of rich red lips <space> and the skin <space> if not <space> white <space> and fair <space>
<space> he would be depressed for many days after witnessing a death bed <space> or hearing of any crime <space> but now margaret noticed <space> an <space> absence of mind <space> as if his thoughts were pre occupied by some subject <space>
<space> missus hale <space> if she spoke truth <space> might have <space> answered with a ready made list <space>
<space> and she repined <space> even more frequently <space> that her husband <space> who was more learned than mister hume <space> a better parish priest than mister houldsworth <space> should not have met <space> with the preferment <space> that these two former neighbours of theirs had <space> done <space>
<space> faintly <space> as if it were an unusual exertion <space> his face returned into its lines of habitual anxiety <space> he had a trick <space> of half opening his mouth as if to speak <space> which constantly unsettled the form of the lips <space>
<space> i call mine a very comprehensive taste <space> i like <space> all people whose occupations have to do with land <space> i like soldiers <space> and sailors <space> and the three learned professions as they call them <space>
<space> if missus shaw had guessed at the real reason why missus hale did not accompany her husband <space> she would have showered down gowns upon her <space> but <space> it was nearly twenty years since missus shaw had been the poor <space> pretty miss beresford <space>
<space> but <space> every <space> day he <space> was more <space> overpowered <space> the world <space> became more bewildering <space> at <space> each repeated urgency of his wife <space> that he would put himself in the way of seeking some preferment <space>
<space> i am so glad i am going home <space> to be at hand to comfort him <space> and mamma <space> she was ready with a bright smile <space> in which there was not a trace of fatigue <space> to greet her father when he awakened <space> he smiled back again but <space>
<space> and for the preservation and restoration of learning when it was threatened with extinction <space> all over england by the ravages of the danes <space> but there were <space> and are <space> englishmen better informed about our country <space>
<space> the second <space> a smaller social history of ancient ireland <space>
<space> this third book <space> the story of <space> ancient <space> irish civilisation <space> gives in simple <space> plain language <space> an account of the condition of the country in the olden time <space> but <space> as it is here to speak for itself <space> i need not describe it further <space>
<space> and as regular as any other european people of the same period <space> they will find too that <space> as regards education scholarship <space> and general mental culture <space> the irish of those early ages were in advance of <space> all <space> other countries of europe <space>
<space> for all the statements it contains <space> full and satisfactory authorities will be found in the two larger works <space> i have done my best to make <space> all three readable and interesting as well as instructive <space>
<space> that they helped most materially to spread christianity and to revive learning <space> all over the continent <space> and that <space> to <space> irish missionaries and scholars <space> the anglo saxons of the heptarchy <space> were indebted for the greater part of their christianity <space>

<space> the first <space> a social history of <space> ancient ireland <space>
<space> contains a complete survey of the social life and institutions of ancient ireland <space> all the important statements in it <space> are proved home by references to authorities <space>
<space> more than three hundred years ago the great english poet <space> edmund spenser <space> lived for some time in ireland <space> and made himself well acquainted with its history <space> he knew what it was in past ages <space>
<space> there are many english and many anglo irish people who think <space> merely from ignorance <space> that ireland was a barbarous and half savage country before the english came among the people and civilised them <space> this book <space> so far as it finds its way among the two classes above mentioned <space> will <space>
<space> five hundred ninety eight pages in twenty seven chapters with <space> two hundred thirteen illustrations <space> traverses the same ground as the larger work <space> but <space> besides condensation <space> most of the illustrative quotations and nearly all the references to authorities are omitted <space>
<space> the ordinary history of our country has been written by many <space> and the reader has a wide choice <space> but in the matter of our social history <space> he has no choice at all <space> for these three books of mine have <space> for the first and only time <space>
<space> nineteen <space> o seven <space> printed by <space> ponsonby and gibbs <space> university press <space> dublin <space> preface <space>
<space> when it was wholly governed by native rulers <space> the publication comes at an appropriate time <space> when there is an awakening of interest in the irish language <space> and in irish lore of every kind <space> unparalleled in our history <space> but the book has a further mission <space>
<space> this little book has been written <space> and published with the main object of spreading as widely as possible among our people <space> young and old <space> a knowledge of the civilisation and general social condition of ireland <space> from the fifth <space> or sixth <space>
<space> brought within the reach of the general public <space> a knowledge <space> of the whole social life <space> of <space> ancient <space> ireland <space> p <space> w j <space> lyre <space> na <space> grena <space> february <space>
<space> but <space> it is better not to pursue these observations farther here <space> as it would be only anticipating what will be found in the body of the book <space> this book <space> is the last of a series of three <space> of which the second is abridged from the first <space> and the third from both <space>
<space> i fancy <space> open their eyes <space> they will learn from it that the old irish so far from being barbarous <space> were a bright intellectual and cultured people <space> that they had professions trades and industries pervading the whole population <space>
<space> with clearly defined ranks <space> and grades of society <space> all working under an elaborate system of native laws <space> and that <space> in the steadying and civilising <space> arts and pursuits of everyday life <space> they were as well advanced as orderly <space>
<space> for the bridge was now altogether broken down <space>
<space> in the meanwhile <space> i <space> so far as one man may do <space> will stay the enemy <space> and as he spake he ran forward <space> to the farther end of the bridge <space> and made ready to keep the way against the enemy <space> nevertheless there stood two with him <space>
<space> lartius <space> and herminius by name <space> men of noble birth <space> both of them <space> and of great renown in arms <space> so these three for a while stayed <space> the first onset of the enemy <space> and <space> the men of rome meanwhile brake <space> down the bridge <space> and when there was but a <space> small part remaining <space>
<space> looking each man to his neighbor who should first <space> deal with this champion of the romans <space> then <space> for very shame they all ran forward <space> and <space> raising a great shout <space> threw their javelins at him <space> these all he took upon his shield <space> nor stood the less firmly in his place on the <space> bridge <space>
<space> fled to lars porsenna <space> king of clusium <space> and besought him that he would help them <space> suffer not <space> they said <space> that we <space> who are tuscans by birth <space> should remain any more in poverty and exile <space>
<space> and as the enemy stayed a while for fear <space> horatius turned him to the river and said <space> o father tiber <space> i beseech thee this day with all reverence that thou kindly receive this soldier and his arms <space> and as he spake <space> he leapt with all his arms into the river <space>
<space> that in freedom which men greatly desire <space> and if they that be kings defend not their dignity as stoutly as others <space> seek to overthrow it <space> then shall the highest be made even as the lowest <space> and there shall be an end of kingship <space> than which there is nothing more honorable under heaven <space>
<space> and take heed also to thyself and thine own kingdom if thou permit this new fashion of driving forth kings to go unpunished <space>
<space> but when men heard of his coming <space> so mighty a city was clusium in those days <space> and so great the fame of king porsenna <space>
<space> and they that brake it down called to the three that they should come back <space> horatius bade lartius and herminius return <space> but he himself remained on the farther side <space> turning his eyes full of wrath <space> in threatening fashion on the princes of the etrurians <space> and crying <space>
<space> and swam across to his own people <space> and <space> though many javelins of the enemy fell about him <space> he was not one whit hurt <space> nor did such valor fail to receive due honor from the city <space>
<space> king porsenna <space> to rob <space> others of the freedom that ye care not to have for yourselves <space>
<space> with these words they persuaded king porsenna <space> who <space> judging it well for the etrurians that there should be a king at rome <space> and that king an etrurian by birth <space> gathered together <space> a great army and came up against rome <space>
<space> worn on the breast <space> suspended from an ornamented button <space> thin circular gold plates were also worn fastened on the breast <space> and as for brooches they were of all shapes and sizes <space> some plain simple and cheap <space>
<space> it was considered shameful for a man of position to have rough <space> unkempt nails <space> crimson coloured finger nails were greatly admired <space>
<space> but it was much shorter and without a collar <space>
<space> whenever men are noble they love <space> bright colour <space>
<space> having serviceable sole and heel <space> and often ornamented with patterns <space> stamped in <space> the irish were excessively fond of personal ornaments <space> which among the higher classes were made of expensive materials <space> such as gold silver gems white bronze et cetera <space>
<space> ladies often dyed the eyebrows black with the juice of some sort of berry <space>
<space> razors were used made of bronze as hard as steel <space> as we know by finding them mentioned in irish documents as early as the eighth century <space> and many old bronze razors are now preserved in museums <space>
<space> like other irish garments it was generally striped or speckled in various colours <space> leggings of cloth or of thin soft leather were used <space> and were laced on by strings tipped with white bronze <space>
<space> and the sprigs and berries of the elder <space> were applied to the same purpose <space> among greek and roman ladies <space> the practice was very general of painting the cheeks <space> eyebrows and other parts of the face <space> both men and women wore the hair long <space>
<space> great care was bestowed on the hair <space> its regulation constituted quite an art <space> and it was dressed up in several ways <space> very often the long hair of men <space> as well as of women <space> was elaborately curled <space> conall <space> kernach's hair <space> as described in the story of <space> da derga <space>
<space> they wore rings and bracelets of various shapes on the fingers <space> including the thumb <space> round <space> the wrist and forearm <space> and even round the leg above the ankle <space>
<space> and we know that they well understood the art of dyeing <space> the several articles of <space> dress on one person were usually coloured <space> differently <space> even the single outer cloak was often striped <space> spotted <space> or chequered in various colours <space> king domnall in the seventh century <space>
<space> in sky <space> sea <space> flowers <space>
<space> from what precedes it will be understood that combs were in general use with men as well as with women <space> and many specimens of combs are now found in the remains of ancient dwellings <space> bathing was very usual at least among the upper classes <space>
<space> in this respect they resembled many <space> other nations of antiquity <space> as well indeed as of the present day <space> and they illustrated ruskin's saying <space>
<space> the men were as particular <space> about the beard as about the hair <space> the fashion of wearing the beard varied <space>
<space> hooks <space> and plaits and swordlets <space>
<space> a short cape was often worn on the shoulders <space> sometimes carrying a hood to cover the head <space> the outer covering of the general run of the peasantry was just one loose sleeved coat or mantle <space>
<space> varying in length but commonly covering the whole person from the shoulders down <space> the people also wore a tight fitting coat with sleeves <space>
<space> in most cases curled up and pointed at the ends as we often see now <space> in many <space> the beard is carefully divided into slender twisted fillets as described above for the hair <space> kings and chiefs had barbers in their service to attend to all this <space>
<space> and baths and the use of baths are constantly mentioned in the old tales and other writings <space> in every public hostel <space> in every monastery and in <space> every <space> high class house <space> there was a bath <space> with its accompaniments <space> soap was used both in bathing and washing <space>
<space> the hair was combed daily after a bath <space> the heroes of the <space> fena of erin <space> before sitting down to their dinner after a hard day's hunting <space> always took a bath and carefully combed their long hair <space> among the higher classes in very early times <space>
<space> on one occasion sent a many coloured tunic to his foster son <space> prince congal <space> like joseph's coat of many colours <space> a very common article of dress was a large cloak <space> generally without sleeves <space>
<space> the modes of manufacturing them will be mentioned <space> silk and satin <space> which were of course imported <space> were much worn among the higher classes <space> the furs of animals <space> such as seals otters badgers foxes et cetera <space> were much used for capes and jackets <space>
<space> the accuracy of this and other similar descriptions <space> is fully borne out <space> by the most <space> unquestionable authority of all <space> namely <space> the figures in the <space> early illuminated manuscripts <space> and on the shrines and high crosses of later ages <space>
<space> they were the marks of aristocracy <space> to these natural advantages the people added by the usual artificial means <space> among the higher classes <space> the finger nails were kept carefully cut and rounded <space>
<space> that the irish missionary monks sometimes painted or dyed <space> their eyelids black <space> an entry in cormac's glossary plainly indicates <space> that the blush of the cheeks <space> was sometimes heightened by a colouring matter obtained from the alder tree <space>
<space> there was a gold ornament <space> a kind of <space> open ring with bosses or buttons on the ends <space>
<space> and is commonly divided <space> the whole way <space> as well as all over the head <space> into slender fillets or locks <space> which sometimes hang down to the eyes in front <space> i do not find mentioned anywhere that the irish dyed <space> their hair <space> as was the custom among the greeks and romans <space>
<space> and when not actually worn was usually carried <space> among other small articles <space> in a lady's ornamental hand <space> bag <space> shoes were often made of <space> untanned hide <space> stitched with thongs with several layers for a sole <space> but there was a more shapely shoe <space> made of fully tanned leather <space>
<space> and for the edgings of various garments <space> so that skins of <space> all the various kinds were valuable <space> they formed too an important item of everyday traffic <space> and they were also exported <space> the ancient <space> irish <space> loved bright colours <space>
<space> flowed <space> down his back <space> and was done up in <space>
<space> a kilt was often worn <space> in which case the legs were left bare at the knees <space> with leggings below <space> for the kilt is of irish origin and was brought <space> like many other fashions <space> by the early colonists <space> to scotland <space>
<space> and gradually narrowed to <space> two points below <space> sometimes <space> as shown in many ancient figures <space> it falls down in a single mass <space> while in a few <space> it is cut <space> straight across at bottom not unlike assyrian beards <space> nearly all have a mustache <space>
<space> girdles <space> strings and loops <space> many of them beautifully made and ornamented <space> the ancient irish wore a trousers which was so tight fitting as to show perfectly the shape of the limbs <space> when terminating below the ankles it was held down by a slender strap <space> passing under the foot <space>
<space> in nearly <space> all the figures of the book of kells <space> for example <space> seventh or eighth century <space> the hair is combed <space> and dressed with the <space> utmost care <space> so beautifully <space> adjusted indeed <space> that it could have been done <space> only by skilled professional hairdressers <space>
<space> and must have <space> occupied <space> much time <space> whether in case of men or women <space>
<space> which covered <space> them down to the ankles <space> and which they wore winter and summer <space> women commonly wore a long loose cloak <space> with a hood <space> a fashion which is common at the present day <space> the over garments were fastened <space> by brooches <space> pins <space> buttons <space>
<space> i sleep no more <space> and i shall not crimson my nails <space> no joy shall ever again come upon my mind <space>
<space> an oval face <space> broad above and narrow below <space> golden hair <space> fair skin <space> white <space> delicate <space> and well formed hands with slender tapering fingers <space> these were considered as marking the type of beauty and of high family descent <space>
<space> all of which materials were found native <space> they had torques for the neck <space> made of twisted gold bars <space> and the <space> elaborate and immensely <space> expensive crescents or gorgets <space>
<space> some of gold or other expensive material <space> of elaborate workmanship <space>
<space> much good may it do him <space> and orpheus <space> whose custom it was to set everything to <space> music <space> began to harp <space> and sing most gloriously <space>
<space> i do not wonder that you think the dragon very terrible <space> you have grown up from <space> infancy in the fear of this monster <space>
<space> provided i bring him the golden fleece <space> this as your majesty is aware <space> is now hanging on a tree here at colchis <space> and i humbly solicit your gracious leave to take it away <space> in spite of himself <space> the king's face twisted itself into an angry frown <space>
<space> i must encounter the peril answered jason composedly <space> since <space> it stands in the way of my purpose <space>
<space> and the four footed pedant <space> his schoolmaster into the bargain <space> why what a foolhardy self conceited coxcomb he is <space> we'll see what my fire breathing bulls will do for him <space> well prince jason <space> he continued aloud <space> and as complaisantly as he could <space>
<space> for beautiful as she now looked <space>
<space> which vulcan <space> the wonderful blacksmith <space> made for me <space> there is a furnace <space> in each of their stomachs and they breathe such hot <space> fire out of their mouths and nostrils <space> that nobody has hitherto <space> gone nigh them without being instantly burned to a small <space> black cinder <space>
<space> i can instruct you how to tame the fiery bulls <space> and sow the dragon's teeth <space> and get <space> the <space> golden <space> fleece <space> indeed beautiful princess <space> answered jason <space> if you will do me this service <space> i promise to be grateful to you my whole life <space> long <space> gazing at medea <space>
<space> every person who might venture within his reach <space> there are other difficulties in the way <space> continued the young princes <space>
<space> the four fiery streams appeared to gush out somewhat more plentifully <space> for the two brazen bulls had heard his foot tramp <space> and were lifting up their hot noses to snuff <space> the air <space> he went a little farther <space>
<space> which will prevent you from being burned up <space> and cure you <space> if you chance to be a little scorched <space>
<space> heard of their arrival <space> he instantly summoned jason to court <space>
<space> or what other cause has procured me the happiness of seeing you at my court <space> great sir replied jason <space>
<space> with a bright gleam along the eastern edge of the sky <space>
<space> had come to colchis <space> with the sole purpose of taking away his chief <space> treasure <space>
<space> yet can never be certain whether you see into the farthest depths <space> or whether there be not something else hidden at the bottom <space> if <space> jason had been capable of fearing anything <space>
which it contained <space> and where to <space> meet her at midnight <space> only be brave added she <space> and before daybreak the brazen bulls shall be tamed <space> the young man assured her that his heart would not fail him <space> he then rejoined his comrades and told them what had passed between the princess and himself <space>
<space> make yourself comfortable for to day <space> and to morrow morning <space> since you insist upon it <space> you shall try your skill at the plow <space> while the king talked with jason <space> a beautiful young woman was standing behind the throne <space> she fixed her eyes <space> earnestly upon the youthful stranger <space>
<space> it is well for you that i am favorably inclined <space> for otherwise you would hardly escape being snapped up by the dragon <space> i should not so much care for the dragon replied jason <space> if i only knew how to manage the brazen footed and <space> fiery lunged <space> bulls <space>
<space> in that farthest <space> corner of <space> the field <space> it will be excellent sport i assure you <space> when they catch a glimpse of your figure <space> my father and all his court delight in nothing so much as to see a stranger trying to yoke them <space> in order to come at the golden fleece <space>
<space> for chiron had taught him how to behave with propriety <space> whether to kings <space> or beggars <space>
<space> and nothing so truly honorable <space> as to be eaten up at one mouthful <space> in case of the worst <space> after this <space> being now under the guidance of the two princes <space> who were well acquainted with the way <space>
<space> these you will understand <space> were caused by the breath of the brazen bulls <space> which was quietly stealing out of their four nostrils <space> as they lay chewing their cuds <space> at the first two or three steps which jason made <space>
why if you will <space> believe me <space> they were the sons of that very phrixus <space> who in his childhood <space> had been carried to colchis on the back of the golden fleeced <space> ram <space> since that time <space> phrixus had married the king's daughter <space>
<space> from which cadmus raised a crop of armed men <space> they are an unruly set of reprobates <space> those sons of the dragon's teeth <space> and unless you treat them suitably <space> they will fall upon you sword in hand <space>
<space> as has always been the fashion with angry bulls <space> their breath scorched the herbage before them <space> so intensely hot it <space> was <space> indeed that it caught a <space> dry tree under which jason was now standing <space> and set it all in a light blaze <space> but as for jason himself <space>
<space> pray are you on a pleasure voyage <space>
<space> princess he exclaimed <space> you seem indeed very wise and very powerful <space> but how can you help me <space> to do the things of which you speak <space> are you an enchantress <space> yes prince jason <space> answered medea with a smile <space>
<space> this young woman followed him out of the room <space> i am the king's daughter <space> she said to him <space> and my name is medea <space> i know a great deal of which other young princesses are ignorant <space> and can do many things which they would be afraid so much as to dream of <space> if you will trust to me <space>
<space> for <space> above all things else in the <space> world <space> he prized the golden fleece <space> and was even suspected of having done a very wicked act <space> in order to get it into his own possession <space>
<space> one other stride did bold jason make <space> and suddenly <space> as a streak of <space> lightning <space> on came these fiery animals <space>
<space> it makes a holiday in colchis <space> whenever such a thing happens <space> for my part i enjoy it immensely <space> you cannot imagine in what a mere twinkling of an eye <space> their hot breath shrivels a young man into a black cinder <space> are you sure beautiful medea asked jason <space>
<space> just as they had been pulled out of the monster's jaws by cadmus long ago <space> medea then led jason down the palace steps <space> and through the silent streets of the city <space> and into the royal pasture ground <space> where the two brazen footed bulls were kept <space> it was a starry night <space>
<space> who dethroned his father <space> you are welcome brave jason <space>
<space> what are the conditions which you must fulfill before getting possession of the golden fleece <space> i have heard rejoined the youth <space> that a dragon lies beneath the tree on which the prize hangs <space> and that whoever approaches him <space> runs the risk of being devoured at a mouthful <space>
<space> and had spent their play days in the outskirts of the grove <space> in the center of which the golden <space> fleece was hanging upon a tree <space> they were now on their way to greece <space> in hopes of getting back a kingdom <space> that had been wrongfully taken from their father <space>
<space> the instant he made a step farther <space>
<space> true said the king <space> with a smile that did not look particularly good natured <space> very true young man <space> but there are other things as hard <space> or perhaps a little harder <space> to be done before you can even have the privilege of being devoured by the dragon <space> for example <space>
<space> he beheld a wonderful intelligence in her face <space> she was one of those persons whose eyes are full of mystery <space> so that while looking into them <space>
<space> and warned them to be in readiness in case there might <space> be need of their help <space> at the appointed hour he met the beautiful medea on the marble steps of the king's palace <space>
<space> at all events <space> turn back who may <space> i will never see greece again <space> unless i carry with me the golden <space> fleece <space> we will none of us turn back <space> cried his nine and forty brave comrades <space>
<space> when the princes understood <space> whither the argonauts were going <space> they offered to turn back and guide them to colchis <space>
<space> will take the trouble to put laurel wreaths on their rusty and battered helmets <space> could you help smiling prince jason <space> to see the self conceit of that last fellow <space>
<space> will he give you the golden <space> fleece <space> without any further risk or trouble <space> on the contrary answered jason <space> he is very angry with me for taming the brazen bulls <space> and sowing the dragon's teeth <space>
<space> and have concluded <space> not to get yourself scorched to a cinder <space> in attempting to tame <space> my brazen lunged bulls <space>
<space> upon my word as the head came waving <space> and <space> undulating through the air <space> and reaching almost within arm's length <space> of <space> prince jason <space> it was a very hideous and uncomfortable sight <space>
<space> you will think differently in the morning said medea <space> true the golden fleece may not be so valuable <space> as you have <space> thought it <space> but then there is nothing better in the world <space> and one must needs <space> have an object <space> you know <space> come <space> your night's work has been well performed <space>
<space> far more effectually <space> than your sword <space> the <space> dragon had probably heard the voices <space> for swift as lightning <space> his black head and forked tongue <space> came hissing among the trees again <space> darting full forty feet at a <space> stretch <space> as it approached <space>
<space> to be sure <space> but the secret of the matter was <space> that the brazen bulls were enchanted creatures <space> and that jason had broken the spell of their <space> fiery <space> fierceness <space> by his bold way of handling them <space> and ever since that time <space>
<space> had thought it best to draw his sword <space> in a moment <space> all the sons of the dragon's teeth <space> appeared to take jason for an <space> enemy <space> and crying with one voice <space> guard the golden fleece <space> they ran at him with <space> uplifted swords and protruded spears <space>
<space> on which he felt inclined to finish his meal <space> in various directions <space> he kept poking his <space> ugly snout <space> among the trees <space> stretching out his neck <space> a terrible long way <space> now here <space>
<space> the armed men were now so nigh that jason could discern the fire flashing out of their enraged eyes <space> when he let <space> fly the stone <space> and saw it strike <space> the helmet of a tall warrior <space> who was rushing upon him with his blade aloft <space>
<space> when he himself fell down <space> and lay quietly among his slain brethren <space> and there was the end of the army <space> that had sprouted from the dragon's teeth <space> that <space> fierce and feverish fight <space> was the only enjoyment <space> which they had tasted on this beautiful earth <space>
<space> the terrible dragon had quite slipped <space> out of jason's memory <space> soon however something came to pass <space> that reminded him what <space> perils were still to be encountered <space> an antelope that probably mistook the yellow radiance for sunrise <space> came <space>
<space> when it glitters before your eyes <space> it is the golden fleece <space> jason went onward a few steps farther <space> and then stopped to gaze <space> o how beautiful it looked <space> shining with a marvelous light of its own <space> that <space>
<space> and he forbids me to make any more attempts <space> and positively refuses to give up the golden fleece <space> whether i slay the dragon <space> or no <space> yes jason said the princess <space> and i can tell you more <space> unless you set sail from colchis <space>
<space> entering the presence chamber <space> he stood at the foot of the throne <space> and made <space> a low <space> obeisance <space> your eyes look heavy prince jason <space> observed the king <space> you appear to have spent a sleepless night <space>
<space> although several stone walls <space> a hill <space> and the black shadows of the grove of mars <space> intervened <space> between <space> by his advice the heroes had seated themselves on the benches of the galley <space>
<space> stealing through the streets of colchis <space> on their way to the sacred grove <space>
<space> so i did not wish to kill him outright <space> quick <space> snatch the prize and let us begone <space> you have won the golden fleece <space> jason caught the fleece from the tree <space>
<space> and a hundred other outcries <space> such as men always bellow forth on a battle field <space> and which these dragon people seemed to have at their tongues ends <space> at last the front <space> rank <space> caught sight of jason <space> who beholding the flash of so many weapons in the moonlight <space>
<space> like sparkling drops of <space> dew <space> these bright objects sprouted higher <space> and proved to be the steel heads of spears <space> then there was a dazzling gleam from a vast number of polished brass helmets <space> beneath which <space> as they grew farther out of the soil <space>
<space> full of rage and stormy passions <space> and ready to take the life of every human brother <space> in recompense <space> of the boon <space> of their own existence <space>
<space> to speak my mind plainly <space> you shall never set eyes on so much as one of its glistening locks <space> jason left the king's presence in great sorrow and anger <space> he could think of nothing better <space>
<space> and whole months before the yellow grain <space> would be ripened for the sickle <space> but by and by <space> all over the field <space>
<space> just as the brazen brutes fancied themselves sure of tossing him into the air <space> he caught one of them by the horn <space> and the other by his screwed up tail <space> and held them in a gripe <space> like that of an iron vice <space> one with his right hand <space> the other with his left <space>
<space> the last survivor <space> the bravest and strongest of the whole <space> had just force enough to wave his crimson sword over his head <space> and give a shout of exultation <space> crying <space> victory <space> victory <space> immortal fame <space>
<space> hewing and stabbing at one another <space> lopping off <space> arms heads and legs <space> and doing such memorable deeds that jason was <space> filled with immense admiration <space> although at the same time <space> he could not help laughing <space> to behold these mighty men <space> punishing each other <space>
<space> and the dragon's teeth <space> the king feared that he would be equally successful in slaying the dragon <space> and therefore <space> though he would gladly have seen jason snapped up at a mouthful <space> he was resolved <space> and it was a very wrong thing of this wicked potentate <space>
<space> at so many mouthfuls by the dragon <space> but as jason was hastening down the palace steps <space>
<space> for he was twisted round the trunk of the tree on which the fleece hung <space> and <space> seizing the poor antelope <space> swallowed him with one snap of his jaws <space> after this feat <space> the dragon seemed sensible that some other living creature was within <space> reach <space>
<space> and instead of running any farther towards jason <space> they began to fight among themselves <space> the confusion spread through the host <space>
<space> what <space> do you think now of your prospect of winning the golden <space> fleece <space> jason <space> answered <space> only by drawing his sword and making a step <space> forward <space> stay foolish youth <space> said medea <space> grasping his arm <space>
<space> and although she had done him so much service only the night before <space> he was by no means very certain that she would not <space> do him <space> an equally great mischief <space> before sunset <space> these enchantresses you must know <space> are never to be depended upon <space>
<space> a large tract of <space> black earth <space> ready to be sown with the dragon's teeth <space> so jason scattered them broadcast and harrowed them into the soil <space> with a brush harrow <space> and took his stand on the edge of the field <space> anxious to see what would happen next <space>
<space> jason followed medea's guidance into the grove of mars <space> where the great oak <space> trees <space> that had been growing for centuries <space> threw so thick a shade that the <space> moonbeams struggled vainly to <space> find their way through it <space>
<space> their fierce nature was thoroughly tamed <space> and with their fierceness <space> the two furnaces in their stomachs <space> had likewise been <space> extinguished <space>
<space> lowing <space> nodding their heads <space> and thrusting forth their snouts <space> which as other cattle do <space>
<space> that the first part of your allotted task is fulfilled <space>
<space> and shattering <space> all its branches as it crashed heavily down again <space> the dragon fell at <space> full length upon the ground and lay <space> quite <space> motionless <space> it is only a sleeping potion <space> said the enchantress <space> to prince jason <space>
<space> and how it would have rejoiced any great captain <space> who was bent on conquering the world <space> like <space> alexander <space> or napoleon <space> to raise a crop of armed soldiers <space> as <space> easily as jason did <space>
<space> who perhaps used to allow himself to be harnessed to the plow <space> at any rate our hero succeeded perfectly well in <space> breaking up the greensward <space> and by the time that the moon was a quarter of her journey <space> up the sky <space> the plowed field lay before him <space>
<space> medea tossed the contents of the gold <space> box <space> right down the monster's wide open throat <space> immediately <space> with an outrageous hiss and a tremendous wriggle <space> flinging his tail up to the tip top <space> of the tallest tree <space>
<space> must we wait long for harvest time <space> he inquired of medea <space> who was now standing by his side <space> whether sooner or later it will be sure to come <space> answered the princess <space> a crop of armed <space> men never fails to spring up <space> when the dragon's teeth have been sown <space>
<space> than ever before <space> indeed it had heretofore been a great inconvenience to these poor animals <space> that whenever they wished to <space> eat a mouthful of grass <space> the fire out of their nostrils had shriveled it up before they could manage to crop it <space>
<space> prize which so many heroes had longed to behold <space> but had perished in the quest of it <space> either by the perils of their voyage <space> or by the fiery breath of the brazen lunged <space> bulls <space> how gloriously it shines cried jason <space> in a rapture it <space>
<space> the field has been plowed <space> the dragon's teeth have been sown broadcast <space> and harrowed into the soil <space>
<space> how they contrived to keep themselves alive <space> is more than i can imagine <space> but now instead of emitting jets of flame and streams of sulphurous vapor <space> they breathed the very sweetest of cow breath <space> after kindly patting the bulls <space>
<space> tore themselves up by the roots <space> wherever a dragon's tooth had fallen <space> there stood a man <space> armed for battle <space> they made a clangor with their swords against their shields <space> and <space> eyed one another fiercely <space>
<space> who were disporting themselves in the moonlight <space> a <space> few hundred <space> feet aloft <space> jason bade them tell the rest of the argonauts to embark as speedily as possible <space> but lynceus with his sharp eyes <space> had already caught a glimpse of him bringing the golden fleece <space>
<space> the gape <space> of his enormous jaws was nearly as wide as the gateway <space> of <space> the king's palace <space> well jason whispered medea <space> for she was <space> ill natured as all enchantresses are <space> and wanted to <space> make the bold youth tremble <space>
<space> greatly encouraged at finding himself not yet turned into a cinder <space>
<space> it was now easy to yoke the bulls <space> and to harness them to the plow <space>
<space> not to run any further risk of losing his beloved fleece <space> you never would have succeeded in this business young man <space> said he <space> if my undutiful daughter medea had not helped you with her enchantments <space> had you acted <space> fairly <space> you would have been at this instant <space>
<space> medea squeezed <space> jason's hand <space> look yonder <space> she whispered <space> do you see it <space> gleaming among the venerable oaks <space> there was a radiance <space> not like the moonbeams <space> but rather resembling the golden glory of the setting sun <space>
<space> when danger assails them <space> to do what they call <space> taking the bull by the horns <space> and to gripe him <space> by the tail is pretty much the same thing <space> that is <space> to <space> throw aside <space> fear <space> and overcome the peril <space> by despising it <space>
<space> with her peacock beside her <space> she clapped her hands for joy and beckoning him to make haste <space> disappeared among the duskiness of the trees <space>
<space> march at <space> once to the grove of mars <space> slay the dragon <space> take possession of the golden fleece <space> get on board the argo <space> and spread all sail for iolchos <space> the success of this scheme depended it is true <space> on the doubtful point <space>
<space> for an offense which he himself had committed <space> in an incredibly short space of time <space> almost as short indeed as it had taken them to grow up <space> all but one of the heroes of the dragon's teeth <space> were stretched lifeless on the field <space>
<space> let them sleep in the bed of honor <space> said the princess medea <space> with a sly smile at jason <space> the world will always have simpletons enough <space> just like them <space> fighting and dying for they know not what <space> and fancying that posterity <space>
<space> clashing their swords against their shields <space> and boiling over with the red hot <space> thirst for battle <space> then they began to shout <space> show us the enemy <space> lead us to the charge <space> death or victory <space> come on brave comrades <space> conquer or die <space>
<space> held perpendicularly <space> ready to let <space> fall into the water <space> as jason drew near <space> he heard the talking image calling to him <space> with more than ordinary eagerness in its grave <space> sweet voice <space> make haste <space> prince jason <space> for your life <space> make haste <space>
<space> what is it asked jason <space> have you come so far to seek it <space>
<space> and depart with my nine and forty comrades <space>
<space> and looked very angry and excessively disturbed <space> for he knew that in accordance with his kingly promise <space> he ought now to permit jason to win the fleece <space> if his courage and skill should enable him to do so <space> but since the young man had met <space> with such good <space> luck <space> in the matter of the brazen bulls <space>
<space> that she was not even perturbed at that <space> but as it were said straight out <space> to him <space> yes it's shut up <space> and so it must be <space> and will be in <space> future <space> now he experienced a feeling <space> such as a man might have <space> returning home and finding his own house locked up <space>
<space> but other people noticed it <space> and that's what <space> upsets him <space> you're not well alexey alexandrovitch <space> she added <space> and she got up <space> and would have gone towards the door <space> but he moved forward <space> as though he would stop her <space> his face was ugly and forbidding <space>
<space> to myself and to god <space> to point out to you <space> your duties <space> our life has been joined <space> not by man <space> but by god <space> that union can only be severed by a crime <space> and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement <space>
<space> as anna had never seen him <space> she stopped <space> and bending her head back <space> and on one side <space> began with her rapid hand <space> taking out her hairpins <space> well i'm listening to what's to come <space> she said calmly <space> and ironically <space> and indeed i listen with <space> interest <space>
<space> i don't understand a word <space> and <space> oh <space> dear how sleepy i <space> am <space> unluckily <space> she said <space> rapidly passing her hand through her hair <space> feeling for the remaining hairpins <space> anna for god's sake don't speak like that he said gently <space> perhaps i am mistaken <space>
<space> she noticed it <space> and asked him the reason <space> to him <space> knowing that every joy <space> every pleasure <space> and pain that she felt <space> she communicated to him at <space> once <space> to him <space> now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind <space>
<space> love <space> can he <space> love <space> if he hadn't heard there was such a thing as love <space> he would never have used the word <space> he doesn't even know what love is <space> alexey alexandrovitch <space> really i don't understand <space> she said <space> define what it is you find <space>
<space> but believe me <space> what i say <space> i say as much for myself as for you <space> i am your husband <space> and i love you <space> for an instant <space> her face fell and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away <space> but the word love threw her into revolt again <space> she thought <space>
<space> it's late alexey alexandrovitch <space> she said <space> when she had gone through the doorway <space> anna <space> it's necessary for me to have a talk with you <space> with me she said wonderingly <space> she came out from behind the door of the dressing room <space> and looked at him <space>
<space> i wasn't dull <space> does that offend you <space> alexey alexandrovitch shivered <space> and bent his hands to make the joints crack <space>
<space> that anyone who did not know her as her husband knew her <space> could not have noticed <space> anything unnatural <space> either in the sound <space> or the sense of her words <space> but to him <space> knowing her <space> knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual <space>
<space> how simple and natural were her words <space> and how likely that she was simply sleepy <space>
<space> began alexey alexandrovitch <space> ferreting in one's soul <space> one often ferrets out something that might have lain there unnoticed <space> your feelings are an affair of your own conscience <space>
<space> when she came into the bedroom <space> he was already in bed <space> his lips were sternly compressed <space> and his eyes looked away from her <space> anna got into her bed and lay <space> expecting <space> every minute <space> that he would begin to speak to her again <space> she both feared his speaking and wished for it <space>
<space> but perhaps the key may yet be found <space> thought alexey alexandrovitch <space> i want to warn you <space> he said in a low voice <space> that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution <space>
<space> and i beg you to listen to it <space> i consider jealousy as you know <space> a humiliating and degrading feeling <space> and i shall never allow myself to be influenced by it <space> but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot be disregarded with impunity <space> this <space> evening it was not <space> i observed it <space>
<space> he had unconsciously become agitated <space> over what was the <space> affair of her conscience <space> and was struggling against the barrier he fancied between them <space>
<space> that my words seem to you <space> utterly <space> unnecessary and out of place <space>
<space> what do you want of me <space> alexey alexandrovitch paused <space> and rubbed his forehead and his eyes <space> he saw that instead of doing as he had intended <space> that is to say <space> warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world <space>
<space> your too animated conversation this evening with count vronsky <space> he enunciated the <space> name firmly and with deliberate emphasis <space> attracted attention <space> he talked and looked at her laughing eyes <space> which frightened him now with their impenetrable look <space>
<space> she heard <space> an even <space> tranquil <space> snore <space> for the first instant <space> alexey alexandrovitch <space> seemed as it were <space> appalled at his own snoring <space> and ceased <space> but after an interval of two breathings <space> the snore sounded again <space>
<space> but judging by the impression made on the company <space> everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what could be desired <space> i positively don't understand said anna <space> shrugging her shoulders <space> he doesn't care she thought <space>
<space> in that case <space> i beg you to forgive me <space> but if you are conscious yourself <space> of even the smallest foundation for them <space>
<space> anna <space> is this you <space> said alexey alexandrovitch <space> quietly making an effort over himself <space> and restraining the motion of his fingers <space>
<space> that she did not care to say a word about herself <space> meant a great <space> deal <space> he saw that the inmost recesses of her soul <space> that had always hitherto lain <space> open before him <space> were closed against him <space> more than that <space> he saw from her tone <space>
<space> but he was silent <space> she waited for a long while without moving <space> and had forgotten about him <space> she thought of that other <space> she pictured him <space> and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the <space> thought of him <space> suddenly <space>
why what is it <space> what about she asked sitting down <space> well let's talk if it's so necessary <space> but it would be better to get to sleep <space> anna said what came to her lips and marveled hearing herself <space> at her own capacity for lying <space>
<space> with a new tranquil <space> rhythm <space> it's late <space> it's late she whispered with a smile <space>
<space> neither the author nor the public have any other concern <space> than as some observation is necessary upon those parts of the work <space> which thirteen years have made <space> comparatively obsolete <space>
<space> but <space> when a young lady is to be a heroine <space> the perverseness of forty surrounding families cannot prevent her <space> something must and will happen <space> to throw <space> a hero <space> in her way <space> mister allen <space>
<space> so <space> at eight years old she began <space> she learnt a year <space> and could not bear it <space> and missus morland who did not insist on her daughters being <space> accomplished in spite of <space> incapacity or distaste <space> allowed her to leave off <space>
<space> her love of dirt <space> gave way to an inclination for finery <space> and she grew <space> clean as she grew smart <space> she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement <space>
<space> she brought herself to read them <space> and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte <space> of her own composition <space> she could listen to other people's performance with very little fatigue <space>
<space> hated confinement and cleanliness <space> and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope <space> at the back of the house <space> such was catherine morland <space> at ten <space> at fifteen <space> appearances were mending <space>
<space> her mother was a woman of useful <space> plain sense <space> with a good temper <space> and <space> what is more remarkable <space> with a good constitution <space> she had three sons before catherine was born <space>
<space> her mother was <space> three months <space> in teaching her only to repeat <space> the beggar's petition <space> and after all her next sister <space> sally could say it better than she did <space> not that catherine was always stupid <space> by no means <space>
<space> not merely to dolls <space> but to the more heroic <space> enjoyments of infancy <space> nursing a dormouse <space> feeding <space> a canary bird <space> or watering a rose bush <space> indeed she had no taste for a garden <space>
<space> she learnt <space> the fable of <space> the hare and many friends <space> as quickly as any girl in england <space> her mother wished her to learn music <space> and catherine was sure she should like it <space> for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet <space>
<space> northanger abbey <space>
<space> this was strange indeed <space> but strange things may be generally accounted for <space> if their cause be fairly searched out <space> there was not one lord in the neighbourhood <space> no <space> not <space> even a baronet <space>
<space> this little work was finished in the year eighteen o three <space> and intended for immediate publication <space> it was disposed of to a bookseller <space> it was even advertised <space>
<space> she had a thin <space> awkward figure <space>
<space> that <space> the poor beetle <space> which we tread upon in corporal sufferance feels a pang as great as when a giant dies <space> and that a young woman in love always looks <space>
<space> there was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door <space> not one young man whose origin was unknown <space> her father had no ward <space> and the squire of the parish <space> no children <space>
<space> and if she gathered flowers at all it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief <space> at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take <space> such were her propensities <space>
<space> than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive <space> missus morland was a very good woman <space> and wished <space> to see her children everything they ought to be <space> but her time was so much occupied in lying in and <space> teaching the little ones <space>
<space> without having seen one <space> amiable youth <space> who could call forth her sensibility <space> without having inspired one real passion <space> and without having excited <space> even any admiration but what was very moderate <space> and very transient <space>
<space> dark <space> lank hair <space> and strong features <space> so much for her person <space> and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind <space> she was fond of all boy's plays <space> and greatly preferred cricket <space>
<space> french by her mother <space> her proficiency in either was not remarkable <space> and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could <space> what a strange <space> unaccountable character <space> for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old <space>
<space> where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number <space> but the morlands had little other right to the word <space> for they were in general very plain <space> and catherine <space> for many years of her life <space> as plain as any <space>
<space> catherine grows quite a good looking girl <space> she is almost pretty today <space> were words which caught her ears now and then <space> and how welcome were the sounds <space> to look <space> almost pretty <space>
<space> the public <space> are entreated to bear in mind that thirteen years have passed <space> since it was finished <space> many more since it was begun <space> and that during that period <space> places <space> manners <space> books <space> and opinions <space> have undergone considerable changes <space>
<space> like patience on a monument <space> smiling <space> at grief <space> so far her improvement was sufficient <space> and in many other points <space> she came on exceedingly well <space> for though she could not write sonnets <space>
<space> she began to curl her hair <space> and long for balls <space> her complexion improved <space> her features were softened by plumpness and colour <space> her eyes gained more animation <space> and her figure more consequence <space>
<space> and from shakespeare she gained a great store of information <space> amongst the rest that <space> trifles light as air <space> are <space> to the jealous confirmation strong as proofs of holy writ <space>
<space> her abilities were quite as extraordinary <space> she never could learn or understand anything before she was taught <space> and sometimes not even then <space> for she was often inattentive and occasionally stupid <space>
<space> the character of her father and mother <space> her own person and disposition <space> were all <space> equally <space> against her <space> her father was a clergyman <space> without being neglected <space> or poor <space> and a very respectable man <space>
<space> who owned the chief of the property about fullerton <space> the village in wiltshire where the morlands lived <space> was ordered to bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution <space> and his lady <space> a good humoured woman <space> fond of miss morland and probably aware that if <space>
<space> she must seek them abroad <space> invited her to go with them <space>
<space> chapter one <space> no one who had ever seen catherine morland in her infancy <space> would have supposed her born to be <space> an heroine <space> her situation in life <space>
<space> and running about the country at the age of fourteen <space> to books <space> or at least books of information <space> for <space> provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them <space> provided they were all story and no reflection <space>
<space> many a flower is born to blush <space> unseen <space> and waste its fragrance on the desert air <space> from thompson that <space> it is a delightful task <space> to teach the young idea how to shoot <space>
<space> she had never any objection to books at all <space> but <space> from fifteen to seventeen she was in training for a heroine <space> she read all such works as heroines must read to supply their memories with those quotations <space> which are so serviceable <space>
<space> her greatest deficiency was in the pencil <space> she had no notion of drawing <space> not enough <space> even to attempt a sketch of her lover's profile <space> that she might be detected in the design <space>
<space> that her elder daughters were inevitably left <space> to shift for themselves <space> and it was not very wonderful that catherine <space> who had by nature nothing heroic about her <space> should prefer cricket <space> baseball <space> riding on horseback <space>
<space> there <space> she fell miserably short of the true heroic height <space> at present <space> she did not know her own poverty <space> for she had no lover to portray <space> she had reached the age of seventeen <space>
<space> had ever since his introduction to isabella <space> been gradually increasing <space> and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment <space> by doubling what he chose to think the amount of mister morland's preferment <space> trebling his private fortune <space>
<space> and <space> designed her for his daughter in law <space> on discovering his error to turn her from the house <space> seemed the best <space> though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself <space> and his contempt <space> of her family <space>
<space> his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy <space> than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them <space> with whomsoever he was or was likely to be connected <space>
<space> and delighted in all the <space> excellencies of her character and <space> truly loved her society <space> i must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude <space> or <space> in other words <space> that a persuasion of her partiality for him <space>
<space> which it must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to catherine <space> would not on any account <space> prevent her accompanying him <space> they began their walk <space> and missus morland was not <space> entirely mistaken <space> in his object in wishing it <space>
<space> and believing that heart to be his own <space> which he had been directed to gain <space> no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent <space>
<space> chapter thirty <space> catherine's disposition <space> was not naturally sedentary <space> nor had her habits been <space> ever very industrious <space> but <space> whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort <space>
<space> she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes till <space> on entering the room <space> the first object she beheld was a young man whom she had never seen before <space>
<space> though it must shock <space> could not <space> intimidate henry <space> who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice <space> he felt himself bound as much in honour <space> as in affection to miss morland <space>
<space> and being at that time not only in daily expectation of morland's engaging isabella <space> but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying catherine himself <space>
<space> had been open <space> and bold <space> the general <space> accustomed on <space> every ordinary occasion <space> to give the law in his family <space> prepared for no reluctance but of feeling <space>
<space> my dear catherine <space> i am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady <space> i do not know when poor richard's cravats would be done <space> if he had no friend but you <space> your head runs too much upon bath <space>
<space> desirous of mister morland's assistance <space> as well in <space> giving encouragement as in finding conversation for her guest <space> whose embarrassment on his father's account she earnestly pitied <space>
<space> upon such intelligence the general had proceeded <space> for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority <space> thorpe's interest in the family <space> by his sister's approaching connection with one of its members <space>
<space> and his own speculations <space> he had yet something more in reserve <space> and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to mister allen's estate <space>
<space> and his own views on another <space> circumstances of which he boasted with almost <space> equal openness <space> seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth <space> and to these were added the absolute facts <space> of the allens being wealthy and childless <space>
<space> to hear you talk so much about the french bread at northanger <space> i am sure i do not care about the bread <space> it is all the same to me what i eat <space> there is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much <space> such a subject <space>
<space> catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this <space> than his own children <space> henry and eleanor <space> perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father's particular respect <space>
<space> and thankful for mister thorpe's communication <space> he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes <space>
<space> some explanation on his father's account he had to give <space> but his first purpose was to explain himself <space> and before they reached mister allen's grounds <space> he had done it so well <space> that catherine did not think it could <space> ever be repeated too often <space>
<space> as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering <space> aiming at a style of life <space> which their fortune could not warrant <space> seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections <space> a forward <space> bragging <space> scheming race <space>
<space> henry <space> in having such things to relate of his father <space> was almost as pitiable <space> as in their first avowal to himself <space> he blushed for the narrow minded counsel which he was obliged <space> to expose <space>
<space> her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter <space> and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of fullerton <space> naturally followed <space>
<space> catherine <space> at any rate <space> heard enough to feel that in suspecting general tilney <space> of either murdering or shutting up his wife <space> she had scarcely sinned against his character <space> or magnified his cruelty <space>
<space> on his return from woodston <space> two days before <space> he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father <space> hastily informed in <space> angry terms of miss morland's departure <space> and ordered to think of her no more <space>
<space> of miss morland's being under their care <space> and <space> as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge <space> of their treating her with parental kindness <space> his resolution was soon formed <space>
<space> and spurning a friendship <space> which could be no longer serviceable <space> hastened to contradict <space> all that he had said before <space> to the advantage of the morlands <space> confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character <space>
<space> hastily left the room to fetch the book in question <space> anxious to lose no time <space> in attacking so dreadful a malady <space> it was some time before she could find what she looked for <space> and other family matters occurring to detain her <space>
<space> and on developing <space> from amidst all her perplexity of words in reply <space> the meaning <space> which one short syllable would have given <space> immediately expressed his intention of paying his respects to them <space> and <space>
<space> had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought <space> it is a new circumstance in romance i acknowledge <space> and dreadfully derogatory <space> of an heroine's dignity <space> but <space> if it be as new in common life <space>
<space> he steadily refused <space> to accompany his father into herefordshire <space> an engagement formed almost at the moment <space> to promote the dismissal of catherine <space> and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand <space>
<space> the general was furious in his anger <space> and they parted in dreadful disagreement <space> henry <space> in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose <space>
<space> in what points his own conjectures might assist him <space> and what portion must yet <space> remain to be told in a letter from james <space>
<space> missus morland had very early dispatched one of the children to summon him <space> but mister morland was from home <space> and being thus without any support <space> at the end of a quarter of an hour she had nothing to say <space>
<space> but <space> when a third night's rest had neither restored her cheerfulness <space> improved her in useful activity <space> nor given her a greater inclination for needlework <space> she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of <space>
<space> but her glowing cheek and <space> brightened eye <space> made her mother trust that this good natured visit <space> would at least set her heart at ease for a time <space> and gladly therefore did she lay aside the first volume of the mirror <space> for a future hour <space>
<space> for missus morland <space> thinking it probable <space> as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours <space> that he might have some explanation to give of his father's behaviour <space>
<space> misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and <space> credit <space> whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither <space>
<space> with a look of much respect <space> he immediately rose <space> and being introduced <space> to her by her conscious daughter as <space> mister henry tilney <space> with the embarrassment of real sensibility <space>
<space> a quarter of an hour had elapsed <space> ere she returned <space> downstairs with <space> the volume from which <space> so much was hoped <space> her avocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself <space>
<space> the conversation between them at northanger <space> had been of the most <space> unfriendly kind <space> henry's indignation on hearing how catherine had been treated <space> on comprehending his father's views <space> and being ordered to acquiesce in them <space>
<space> and it seemed as if she could even walk about the house <space> rather than remain fixed <space> for any time in the parlour <space> her loss of spirits <space> was a yet greater alteration <space> in her rambling and her idleness <space>
<space> his own consequence always required that theirs <space> should be great <space> and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew <space> so regularly <space> grew their fortune <space> the expectations of his friend morland <space> therefore <space> from the first overrated <space>
<space> henry was convinced of his father's believing it <space> to be an advantageous connection <space> it was not till <space> the late explanation at northanger <space> that they had the smallest idea <space> of the false calculations which had hurried him on <space>
<space> had seen with astonishment <space> the suddenness <space> continuance and extent of his attention <space> and though latterly <space> from some hints <space> which had accompanied an almost <space> positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her <space>
<space> bestowing a rich aunt <space> and sinking half the children <space> he was able to represent the whole family to the general <space> in a most respectable light <space> for catherine however the peculiar object of the general's curiosity <space>
<space> asked her if she would have the goodness to show him the way <space> you may see the house from this window sir <space> was information on sarah's side <space> which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman <space> and a silencing nod from her mother <space>
<space> nothing to lay to her charge <space> but her being the involuntary <space> unconscious object <space> of a deception <space> which his pride could not pardon <space> and which <space> a better pride <space> would have been ashamed <space> to own <space>
<space> i leave it to my reader's <space> sagacity <space> to determine how much of all this it was possible for henry to communicate <space> at this time to catherine <space> how much of it he could have learnt from his father <space>
<space> no opposing desire that should <space> dare to clothe itself in words <space> could ill brook the opposition of his son <space> steady as the sanction of reason and <space> the dictate of conscience could make it <space> but <space> in such a cause <space> his anger <space>
<space> been constrained to acknowledge himself <space> incapable <space> of giving the young people <space> even a decent support <space> they were in fact <space> a necessitous family <space> numerous too <space> almost beyond example <space> by no means respected in their own neighbourhood <space>
<space> for after coming eagerly forward on the first <space> overture of a marriage between the families <space> with the most liberal <space> proposals <space> he had <space> on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator <space>
<space> the credit of a wild imagination <space> will at least <space> be all my own <space> a very short visit to missus allen <space> in which henry talked at random <space> without sense or connection <space> and catherine <space>
<space> after a couple of minutes <space> unbroken silence henry <space> turning to catherine for the first time since her mother's entrance <space> asked her <space> with sudden alacrity <space> if mister and missus allen <space> were now at fullerton <space>
<space> that would be turning your visit into an evil indeed <space> wherever you are you should always be contented <space> but <space> especially at home <space> because there you must spend the most of your time <space> i did not quite like <space> at breakfast <space>
<space> for ten to one whether you ever see him again <space> you should never fret about trifles <space> after a short silence <space> i hope <space> my catherine <space> you are not getting out of humour with home <space> because it is not so grand as northanger <space>
<space> catherine took up her work directly <space> saying <space> in a dejected voice that <space> her head did not <space> run upon bath <space> much <space> then you are fretting about general tilney <space> and that is very simple of you <space>
<space> john thorpe had first misled him <space> the general <space> perceiving his son one night at the theatre <space> to be paying considerable attention to miss morland <space>
<space> scarcely opened her lips <space> dismissed them to the <space> ecstasies of another tete a tete <space> and before it was suffered to close <space> she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority <space> in his present application <space>
<space> could not but rejoice in the kind caution <space> with which henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection <space> by engaging her faith <space> before he mentioned the subject <space>
<space> her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased <space> she could neither sit still <space> nor employ herself for ten minutes together <space> walking round the garden and orchard again and again <space> as if nothing but motion was voluntary <space>
<space> about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance <space> the mirror <space> i think <space> i will look it out for you some day or other because i am sure it will do you good <space> catherine said no more <space> and <space> with an endeavour to do right <space>
<space> had <space> accidentally inquired of thorpe <space> if he knew more of her than her name <space> thorpe <space> most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of general tilney's importance <space> had been joyfully and <space> proudly communicative <space>
<space> that they were false <space> the general had learnt from the very person who had suggested them <space> from thorpe himself <space> whom he had chanced <space> to meet again in town and <space> who <space> under the influence of exactly opposite feelings <space>
<space> though his heart was greatly relieved by such <space> unlooked for mildness <space> it was not <space> just at that moment in his power to say anything to the purpose <space> returning in silence to his seat <space> therefore <space>
<space> irritated by catherine's refusal <space> and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between morland and isabella <space> convinced <space> that they were separated forever <space>
<space> missus morland <space> had been always kindly disposed <space> towards each <space> and instantly <space> pleased by his appearance <space> received him with the simple professions of <space> unaffected benevolence <space> thanking him <space> for such an attention to her daughter <space>
<space> began to apologize for his appearance there <space> acknowledging that after what had passed he had little right to expect a welcome at fullerton <space> and stating his impatience to be assured of miss morland's having reached her home in safety <space>
<space> such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand <space> the affrighted catherine <space> amidst all the terrors of expectation <space> as she listened to this account <space>
<space> applied to her work <space> but <space> after a few minutes <space> sunk again <space> without knowing it herself <space> into languor and listlessness <space> moving herself in her chair <space> from the irritation of weariness <space> much oftener <space> than she moved her needle <space>
<space> as the cause of his intrusion <space> he did not address himself to an uncandid judge <space> or a resentful heart <space> far from comprehending him or his sister in their father's misconduct <space>
<space> and he knew the young man on whom the fullerton estate must devolve <space> the general needed no more <space> enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself <space> he set out the next day for the abbey <space> where his performances <space> have been seen <space>
<space> the terrified general pronounced <space> the name of allen with an inquiring look <space> and here too thorpe had learnt his <space> error <space> the allens he believed <space> had lived near them too long <space>
<space> i did have when i was a tadpole <space> said the tree frog <space> i had a beautiful wiggly little tail with which to swim through the waters of the pond <space> but as my legs grew larger and stronger <space> my tail grew littler and weaker <space> until there wasn't any tail left <space>
<space> as you may guess i stayed there a long time watching these strange creatures work <space>
<space> i had enough to eat <space> but anybody who has been free cannot be happy shut in <space> i watched my chance <space> and three times i got out when the little door was not quite closed <space> twice i was caught and put back <space>
<space> i hopped along as fast as i could <space> for i did not then know enough to be afraid <space> i got close up to them both and saw strange big creatures going in and out of the red thing <space> the barn <space> as i afterward found it was called <space>
<space> oh how happy we were then <space> i remember the day when my hind legs began to grow <space> and how the other tadpoles crowded around me in the water and swam close to me to feel the two little bunches that were to be legs <space>
<space> when he first came to his home by the elm tree he was very thin <space> and looked as though he had been sick <space> the katydids who stayed near said that he croaked in his sleep <space> and that you know <space> is not what well and happy frogs should do <space>
<space> in all the meadow there was nobody who could tell such interesting stories as the old tree frog <space> even the garter snake <space> who had been there the longest <space> and the old cricket <space> who had lived in the farm yard <space> could tell no such exciting tales as the tree frog <space>
<space> i was a bold young fellow <space> and when i saw a great white thing among the trees up yonder <space> i made up my mind to see what it was <space> there was a great red thing in the yard beside it <space> but i liked the white one better <space>
<space> it makes my skin dry to think of it now <space> and friends <space> the best way i can ever repay your kindness to me <space> is to tell you to never <space> never <space> never <space> never <space> go near the farm house <space> and they all answered <space>
<space> and i could hear a roaring sound which meant they were talking and laughing <space> the last time i got out <space>
<space> after they stopped hunting <space> the wind blew the door open and i hopped out <space> you don't say <space> exclaimed a grasshopper <space>
<space> i played and ate with my brothers and sisters <space> and little dreamed what trouble was in store for me when i grew up <space> we were all in a hurry to be frogs <space>
<space> all the wonderful things of which he told had happened before he came to the meadow <space>
<space> one day when many of the meadow people were gathered around him <space> he told them his story <space> when i was a little fellow <space> he said <space> i was strong and well <space> and could leap farther than any other frog of my size <space>
<space> the knobs on the ends of my toes were sticky <space> so that i could climb a tree <space> and then i was ready to start on my travels <space> some of the other frogs started with me <space> but they stopped along the way <space> and at last i was alone <space>
<space> i was hatched in the pond beyond the farm house <space> and ate my way from the egg <space> to the water outside like any other frog <space> perhaps i ought to say <space> like any other tadpole <space> for of course i began life as a tadpole <space>
<space> wonderful indeed <space> and at the top <space> continued the tree frog <space> was something white over the doorway into my prison <space> in the bottom were water and a stone <space> and from the bottom to the top was a ladder <space>
<space> my fore legs did not grow until later <space> and these bunches came just in front of my tail <space> your tail <space> cried a puzzled young cricket <space>
<space> none of his friends had known him then <space> but he was an honest fellow <space> and they were sure that everything he told was true <space> besides they must be true <space> for how could a body ever think out such remarkable tales from his own head <space>
<space> but for a long time i could not sleep without dreaming that i was back in prison <space> and i would croak in my sleep at the thought of it <space> i heard you <space> cried the katydid <space> and i wondered what was the matter <space> matter enough <space> said the tree frog <space>
<space> the queerest thing about it was that the smaller creatures seemed to make the larger ones do whatever they wanted them to <space> they even made some of them help do their work <space> you may not believe me <space> but what i tell you is true <space>
<space> in the pleasant weather of course i went to the top of the ladder <space> and when it was going to rain i would go down again <space> every time that i went up or down those dreadful creatures would put their faces up close to my prison <space>
<space> she picked me up and carried me inside <space> oh how frightened i was <space> my heart thumped as though it would burst and i tried my best to get away from her <space> she didn't hurt me at all <space> but she would not let me go <space>
<space> the largest creatures had four legs <space> and some of them had horns <space> the smaller creatures had only two legs on which to walk <space> and two other limbs of some sort with which they lifted and carried things <space>
<space> she put me in a very queer prison <space> at first when she put me down on a stone in some water <space> i did not know that i was in prison <space> i tried to hop away and <space> bump went my head against something <space>
<space> there were some bright colored flowers near the house <space> and i crawled in among them <space> there i rested until sunset <space> and then began my evening song <space> while i was singing <space> one of the people from the house came out and found me <space>
<space> they said it was not genteel to hurry <space> no matter what happened <space> one day the tree frog was under the tree when the large brown walking stick decided to lay some eggs <space> he saw her dropping them carelessly around on the ground and asked <space>
<space> then there was a great scrambling and the crickets frolicked with them <space> the young walking stick thought it looked like great fun and almost wished herself some other kind of insect <space> so that she could tumble around in the same way <space> she did not quite wish it <space> you understand <space>
<space> and when they had slept enough they awakened <space> they had nothing to do but to eat and sleep <space> and they did not often take the trouble to think <space> they felt that they were a little better than those meadow people who rushed and scrambled and worked from morning until night <space> and they showed very plainly how they felt <space>
<space> their feelers were held quite close together <space> and they did not move their feet at all <space> only swayed their bodies gracefully from side to side <space> now they were on the ground <space> hunting through the flat piles of cut grass for some fresh and juicy bits to <space> eat <space>
<space> he knew just what to expect <space> so when the nuthatch set him down on the bark to look at him <space> he unhooked his feet from the bark and tumbled to the ground <space> the nuthatch tried to catch him and broke off one of his legs <space> but she never found him again <space> although she looked and looked and looked and looked <space>
<space> ah he has the true walking stick spirit <space> then they paid no more attention to him <space> and after a while he and his sister and their green little friend left the forest for the meadow <space> on the day when the grass was cut <space> they had sat quietly in their trees and looked genteel <space>
<space> the same long feelers <space> and the same sort of long slender legs <space> if you had passed them in a hay field <space> you would surely have thought each a stem of hay <space> unless you happened to see them move <space> the other walking stick <space> their friend <space> was younger and green <space>
<space> it is just to be genteel <space> to act as you see us act <space> and to <space> just here the hay tedder passed over them <space> and every one of the walking sticks was sent flying through the air and landed on his back <space>
<space> perhaps they were not happy with their relatives <space> but then <space> if one is a walking stick you know <space> one does not care so very much about one's family <space> these walking sticks had grown up the best way they could <space> with no father or mother to care for them <space>
<space> the ants were scrambling around as busy as ever <space> and life went on quite as though neither men nor horses had ever entered the meadow <space> see <space> cried a spider who was busily looking after her web <space> there comes a horse drawing something and the farmer sitting on it and driving <space>
<space> and would never have thought of it if she had turned <space> brown <space> ah <space> said the five legged walking stick <space> what scrambling <space> how very common <space> yes indeed <space> said his sister <space> why can't they learn to move slowly and gracefully <space>
<space> perhaps they can't help being fat <space> but they might at least act genteel <space> what is it to be genteel <space> asked a grasshopper suddenly <space> he had heard every word that the walking stick said <space> why <space> said the five legged walking stick <space>
<space> of course you know spiders never do have a hundred <space> and a walking stick wouldn't be walking without any <space> but that was just his way of speaking <space> and it showed what kind of insect he was <space> his relatives all waved their feelers one at a time and said <space>
<space> that was because he crawled into a clump of ferns and kept very still <space> his sister came and looked at him and said <space> now <space> if you were only a spider it would not be long before you would have six legs again <space>
<space> when the horse was well into the meadow <space> the farmer moved a bar <space> and the queer looking machine began to kick the grass this way and that <space> with its many stiff and shining legs <space> a frisky young grasshopper kicked in the same way <space> and happened <space> just happened of course <space>
<space> she had once told her brother the five legged walking stick that she would not want to live if she could not be genteel <space> she thought the meadow people very common <space> the five legged walking stick looked much like his sister <space> he had the same long slender body <space>
<space> the dignified <space> walking sticks <space> three walking sticks from the forest had come to live in the big maple tree near the middle of the meadow <space> nobody knew exactly why they had left the forest <space> where all their sisters and cousins and aunts lived <space>
<space> they had never been taught to do anything useful <space> or to think much about other people <space> when they were hungry they ate some leaves <space> and never thought what they should eat the next time that they happened to be hungry <space> when they were tired they went to sleep <space>
<space> some mothers do not think it too much trouble to be careful where they lay eggs <space> that may be <space> said the brown walking stick <space> but they do not belong to our family <space> she spoke as if those who did not belong to her family might be good but could never be genteel <space>
<space> the walking sticks looked very uncomfortable <space> and the brother and sister could not think of anything to say <space> it was the young green one who spoke at last <space>
<space> do you never fix a place for your eggs <space> a place <space> said the brown walking stick <space> waving her long and slender feelers to and fro <space> a place <space> oh no <space> i think they will hatch where they are <space> it is too much trouble to find a place <space>
<space> they had such <space> ugly mouths and such quick motions <space> the larger fishes kept away on account of their children <space> who were small and tender <space> one might think that the sand hill cranes the fish hawks <space> and the other shore families would have been good friends for them <space> but when they called <space>
<space> the clever water adder <space> none of the pond people were alone more than the water adders <space> the snapping turtle was left to himself a great deal until the day when he and belostoma drove away the boys <space> after that <space>
and you know what you mean but i have to <space> eat something <space> and if i am swimming under the water and a duckling paddles along just above me and sticks his foot into my mouth i am likely to swallow him before i think <space> the water adder saw that he was provoked by what she had said <space> so she talked about something else <space>
<space> that was belostoma's <space> way <space> he would sting people who bothered him <space> but then he always said that they need not have bothered him <space> and perhaps that was so <space> with the water adders it was different <space> they were good natured enough <space>
<space> you see she was vain as well as clever <space> the snapping turtle felt cross to day <space> and had come to see if a talk with her would not make him feel better <space> the mud turtle was tired of having the children sprawl around him <space>
<space> she could do almost anything and she knew it <space> she talked about it too <space> and that showed bad taste <space> and was one reason why she was not liked better <space> she could swim very fast <space> could creep <space> glide <space>
<space> let them come in swimming with their children <space> if they are warm and tired <space> the water adder laughed in her snaky way <space> and showed her sharp teeth <space> i have heard <space> she said <space> that when the wild ducks bring their children here to swim <space>
<space> and fly around in the sunshine to find food for their children <space> ah yes <space> said the mud turtle <space> how they must wish for shells <space> humph <space> said the snapping turtle <space> what for <space> to fly with <space>
<space> they certainly are <space> agreed the snapping turtle <space> who was beginning to feel much better natured <space> what did you say <space> asked the adder who <space> like all her family <space> was a little deaf <space> ouch <space> exclaimed the snapping turtle <space>
<space> after that i shall fly away on my wedding trip <space> missus belostoma may go with me <space> if she feels like doing so after laying her eggs here <space> i shall go anyway <space> and i shall flutter and sprawl around the light <space> and sting people who bother me <space> and have a happy time <space>
<space> two naughty young water boatmen had swum quietly up on their backs and stung the turtles on their tails <space> then they swam away <space> pushing themselves quickly through the water with swift strokes of their hairy oar legs <space>
<space> said the mud turtle <space> and he swam away with the snapping turtle <space> what a rude person she is <space> they said <space> always trying to show how much more clever she is than other people <space> we would rather be stupid and polite <space> after a while the snapping turtle said <space>
<space> that when young ducks dive head first <space> they are quite sure to come up again <space> but that when they dive feet first <space> they never come up <space>
<space> most of them <space> remarked the turtles <space> all of them <space> she said <space> except us adders and the turtles <space> i even <space> think that some of the turtles are a little queer don't you <space> we have thought so <space> said the mud turtle <space>
<space> but then <space> you know <space> we are not stupid <space> of course not <space> replied the mud turtle <space>
<space> asked the snapping turtle and he was snappy about it <space> oh <space> nothing <space> replied the water adder <space> swinging her head back and forth and looking at the scales on her body <space> i know what you mean <space> said the snapping turtle <space>
<space> i think the ducks spoil their children <space> said she <space> they make such a fuss over them <space> and they are not nearly so bright as my children <space> why <space> mine hatch as soon as the eggs are laid <space> and go hunting at once <space> they are no trouble at all <space>
<space> i wish <space> said he <space> that the chilly feeling would be big enough to go way through to their bellies <space> their bellies are only the front side of their backs anyway <space> he added <space> because they are so thin <space> of course this was a dreadful wish to make <space>
<space> the adders were always away <space> people said that the adders were afraid of them <space> the yellow brown frog wished that the adders could be scared <space> badly scared some time <space> so scared that a chilly feeling would run down their backs from their heads clear to the tips of their tails <space>
<space> catch hold of things with her tail <space> hang herself from the branch of a tree <space> lift her head far into the air <space> leap <space> dart <space> bound and dive <space> all her family could do these things <space> but she could do them a little the best <space> one day she was hanging over the pond in a very graceful position <space>
<space> and he pulled his tail out of the mud and swam away <space>
<space> his neighbors began to understand him better and he was less grumpy <space> so that those who wore shells were soon quite fond of him <space> belostoma did not have many friends among the smaller people <space> and only a few among the larger ones <space> they said that he was cruel <space>
<space> asked the water adder in her sweetest voice <space> nothing is easier <space> and she wound herself around the willow branch in another graceful position <space> and took the tip of her tail daintily between her teeth <space> humph <space> said the snapping turtle <space>
<space> ouch <space> ouch <space> what is the matter <space> asked the mud turtle <space> then he began to slap the water with his short stout tail and say <space> ouch <space>
<space> and he backed into the mud knowing that fine soft mud is the best thing in the world for stings <space>
<space> yet the mud turtles and snapping turtle were the only ones who ever called upon them and found them at home <space> the small people without shells were afraid of them <space> and the clams and pond snails never called upon any one <space> the minnows said they could not bear the looks of the adders <space>
<space> and of missus mud turtle telling about the trouble she had to get the right kind of food <space> the clever water adder spoke first of the weather <space> it must be dreadfully hot for the shore people <space> she said <space>
<space> with her tail twisted carelessly around a willow branch <space> the snapping turtle and a mud turtle father were in the shallow water below her <space> her slender forked tongue was darting <space> in and out of her open mouth <space>
<space> and that he had a bad habit of using his stout sucking tube to sting with <space> still <space> belostoma did not care <space> he said <space> a giant water bug does not always live in the water <space> i shall have my wings soon <space> and leave the water and marry <space>
<space> if i could only reach my tail with my head <space> or even with one of my hind feet <space>
<space> but people said that one of the adders had frightened the yellow brown frog so that he never got over it <space> and this was the reason he felt so <space> the water adders were certainly the cleverest people in the pond <space>
<space> i never worry about mine <space> said the mud turtle <space> although their mother thinks it is not safe for them all to sleep at once as they do on a log in the sunshine <space> it isn't <space> said the adder decidedly <space> i never close my eyes <space>
<space> they do not always take so many home as they brought <space> the snapping turtle became very much interested in his warty right foreleg <space> and did not seem to hear what she said <space> the mud turtle smiled <space> i have heard <space> she went on <space>
<space> it is useful in feeling of things <space> she said <space> and then <space> i have always thought it quite becoming <space> she could see herself reflected in the still water below her <space> and she noticed how prettily the dark brown of her back shaded into the white of her belly <space>
<space> when a crane is as much excited as that <space> it is pretty serious <space> to my sister <space> she asked carelessly <space> as she drew one of her long tail feathers through her beak <space> no <space> said he <space> i bowed to her sister <space>
<space> he pitied short necked people <space> then he said <space> pooh <space> i can take bigger mouthfuls than that <space> you ought to see what big mouthfuls i can take <space> she changed and stood on her other leg <space> i saw you dancing this morning <space> she said <space>
<space> as they came near the pond <space> they flew lower and lower <space> until all swept down to the earth and alighted <space> tall and stately <space> by the edge of the water <space> they had eaten nothing for several days <space> and were soon hunting for food <space> some on land <space>
<space> when they were eating <space> the young fellow who had begun the dance stalked up to the sister of one of his friends <space> as she stood in the edge of the pond <space> gracefully balanced on one leg <space> she did not turn her head towards him <space> although having such a long and slender neck <space>
<space> he bowed to her oftener than to any of the rest <space> and he thought she noticed it <space> they danced until they were almost too tired to move <space>
<space> they were those who thought of staying there for the summer <space> when the flock arose to fly on again <space> eight cranes stayed behind <space> they watched their friends fly away <space> and stood on the ground with their necks and bills uplifted and mouths open <space>
<space> for all the eight cranes had danced together <space> but he thought it very wonderful <space> did you notice to whom i bowed <space> he asked <space> he was so excited that his knees shook <space> and he had to stand on both legs at once to keep from falling <space>
<space> and she said she couldn't remember <space> that she never could remember what she had forgotten <space> it made him feel very badly to have her leave him so <space> he wanted a chance to tell her something yet <space> whenever he tried to it seemed to stick in his bill <space> he began to fear that she didn't like him <space>
<space> as she stalked off toward the pond she passed him <space> and she said over her shoulder <space> i should think you would be hungry <space> i am almost starved <space> after she had gone <space> he wondered why she had said that <space>
and their long legs gave them a very genteel look <space> the tops of their heads were covered with warty red skin <space> from which grew short black feathers that looked more like hairs <space> one morning when the cranes awakened <space>
<space> and the next time the cranes danced he didn't bow to her so much <space> but he strutted and leaped and whooped even more <space> and she strutted and leaped and whooped almost as loudly as he <space> when they were all tired out and had stopped dancing <space> she said to him <space> i am so tired <space>
<space> she stood with her head on her breast and looked at the water <space> after a while he trumpeted softly <space> as though he were just trying his voice <space> then she gave a pretty little start <space> and said <space> oh <space> are you here <space> how you did frighten me <space>
<space> and was afraid she might marry him if he was not quick <space> now he pointed with one wing to this nesting place and said <space> how would you like to build a nest there <space> she looked where he had pointed <space> i <space> she said <space> why <space>
<space> or if they had been flying by night as they usually did <space> they would have stayed nearer the ground <space> and their leader would have trumpeted loudly to let his followers know which way he was going <space> they would also have trumpeted <space> but more softly <space> to tell him that they were coming after <space>
<space> every crane danced brothers and sisters and all <space> and as they did so <space> they looked lovingly at each other <space> and admired the fine steps and enjoyed the whooping <space> this went on until they were so tired they could hardly stand <space> and had to stop to <space> eat and rest <space>
<space> then he thought that <space> if she liked the place so well <space> she might come there again the next day <space> he wondered why he could not come too <space> although everybody knows that a crane catches more if he fishes alone <space> the next morning when the cranes danced <space>
<space> let us go off into the woods and rest <space> you may be very sure he was glad to go <space> and as he stalked off with her <space> he led the way to a charming nesting place <space> he didn't know just how to tell what he wanted to <space> but he had seen another crane bowing to her <space>
<space> when did you think of it <space> so they were married <space> and missus sand hill crane often told her friends afterward that mister crane was so much in love with her <space> that she just had to marry him <space> they were very very happy <space> and after a while <space>
<space> if he had been an older crane and understood the ways of the world a little better <space> he would have known that she meant <space> aren't you coming to that fishing place <space> i am going now <space>
<space> and one crane kept awake to watch for danger while the others tucked their heads under their wings <space> they were fine looking even when they slept <space> and some people never look well unless they are awake <space> they were brownish gray <space> with no bright markings at all <space>
<space> even the frogs who are afraid of cranes <space> crept quietly near to look on <space> it was not long before another young crane began to skip and hop and circle around <space> drooping his wings and whooping as he went <space>
<space> still <space> although he was such a young crane and had never danced until this year <space> he began to think that she liked him and enjoyed having him near <space> so he flew off to the fishing place where he had seen her the day before <space> and he stalked along to where she was <space>
<space> while they trumpeted or called out <space> good bye <space> stop for us in the fall <space> the flying cranes trumpeted back <space> we will <space> don't forget us <space> that night they slept near together <space> as they had done when with the large flock <space>
<space> it is a lovely place but i could never have a nest alone <space> let me help you <space> he said <space> i want to marry <space> and have a home <space> why <space> said she as she preened her feathers <space> that is a <space> very good plan <space>
<space> he would bend his body stretch out his neck <space> open his long slender bill <space> and swallow it at one gulp <space> then he would seem to fall asleep again <space> while most of the cranes were still feeding <space> some of them were stalking through the woods and looking this way and that <space>
<space> the dance of the sand hill cranes <space> one fine day in spring <space> a great flock of sand hill cranes came from the south <space> they were flying high and quietly because the weather was bright <space> if it had been stormy <space>
<space> they were a fine company to look upon <space> orderly strong and dignified <space> their long necks were stretched out straight ahead <space> their long legs straight behind <space> and they beat the air with slow regular strokes of the strong wings <space>
<space> i am sorry <space> he said <space> i did not want to frighten you <space> and he looked at her admiringly <space> it was just for a minute <space> she answered <space>
<space> and some in the water <space> for they had stopped to feed and rest <space> those who hunted in the water did so very quietly <space> a crane would stand on one leg with his head against his breast <space> so quietly that one might think him asleep <space> but as soon as anything eatable came near <space>
<space> a fine young fellow began to strut up and down before the rest <space> bowing low and leaping high into the air <space> and every now and then whooping as loudly as he could <space> the gulls who had spent the winter by the pond <space> screamed to each other <space> the crane dance has begun <space>
<space> then they stood and fished for a long time without saying anything <space> when she flew away she said <space> that is a very pleasant fishing place <space> he stood on the other leg for a while <space> and thought how sweet her voice sounded as she said it <space>
<space> and holds her long stiff <space> buggy whip <space> so that it swipes me viciously across the face <space> knocks my helmet off into the mud ditch <space>
<space> the very fair wagon road <space> the maumee river winding through its splendid rich valley seems to possess a peculiar beauty all its own <space> and my mind unbidden mentally <space> compares it with our old friend the humboldt <space>
has had an extra stout bone shaker made to order <space>
<space> the gleaming waters of lake erie <space> here and there glisten like burnished steel through the distant interspaces <space> and away beyond stretches northward <space> like a vast mirror <space> to kiss the blue canadian skies <space>
<space> at la porte the roads improve for some distance but once again <space> i am benighted and sleep under a wheat shock <space> traversing several miles of corduroy road through huckleberry swamps next morning i reach cram's <space> point for breakfast <space>
<space> but it isn't <space> the ohioans are to the manner born <space> the buckeye yell is a tangible fact <space> all along the maumee it resounds in my ears <space> nearly every man <space> or boy <space> who from the fields far or near <space>
<space> leading through the broad <space> and smiling <space> cattaraugus valley <space> that is spread out like a vast garden below <space> through which cattaraugus creek <space> slowly winds its tortuous way <space> stopping over night at angola <space>
<space> sees me bowling along the road straightway delivers himself of a yell <space> pure and simple <space> at perrysburg i strike the famous maumee pike <space> forty miles of stone road almost a dead level <space>
<space> i proceed to buffalo next morning <space> catching the first glimpse of that important seaport of the lakes <space> where fifteen miles across the bay the wagon road is almost licked by the swashing waves <space> and entering the city over a misfit plank road <space>
<space> no wheelman has ever yet <space> rode up this hill <space> save the muscular and gritty captain <space> of the fredonia club <space> though several have attempted the feat <space> from the top <space> my road ahead is <space> plainly visible for miles <space>
<space> the latter stream traverses dreary plains <space> where almost nothing but sagebrush grows <space> the maumee waters a smiling valley <space> where orchards fields and meadows alternate with <space> sugar maple groves <space>
<space> i take a flying visit by rail to see niagara falls <space> returning the same evening to enjoy the proffered hospitality <space> of a genial member of the buffalo bicycle club <space>
<space> is so delightfully romantic <space> at ten o'clock in the morning july seventeenth i bowl across the boundary line into ohio <space> following the merchants and bankers telegraph road to napoleon <space> i pass through a district where the rain has overlooked them for two months <space>
<space> and scarcely know a word of english yet <space> a fat phlegmatic looking baby is peacefully reposing in a cradle <space> which is simply half a monster pumpkin scooped out and dried <space> it is the most intensely rustic <space> cradle in the world <space>
<space> splendid gravel roads lead from crum's point <space> to south bend and on through mishawaka <space> alternating <space> with sandy stretches to goshen <space> which town is said by the goshenites <space> to be the prettiest <space> in indiana <space>
who being about fifty per cent less bulky <space> ride regulation wheels <space> jumbo goes all right when mounted <space> but being <space> unable to mount without aid <space> he seldom ventures abroad by himself for fear of having to foot it back <space>
<space> as <space> it is about six thousand feet above the level of the sea <space> and has three steamers plying on its waters <space> at fredonia i am shown through the celebrated watch movement factory here <space>
<space> are enticed into a political meeting by <space> a wily politician <space> and dexterously made to pose before the assembled company <space> as two gentlemen who have come one from the atlantic <space> the other from the pacific <space>
<space> but there seems to be considerable pride of locality in the great hoosier state <space> and i venture <space> there are scores of prettiest towns in indiana <space> nevertheless goshen is certainly a very handsome place with unusually broad <space> well shaded streets <space>
<space> riding down far famed euclid avenue <space> and calling <space> at lake view cemetery to pay a visit to garfleld's tomb <space> i bid them farewell at euclid village <space> following the ridge road <space> leading <space> along <space> the shore <space> of lake erie <space> to buffalo <space>
<space> i ride through a most beautiful farming country <space> passing through willoughby <space> and mentor <space> garfield's old home <space>
<space> and so it continues with ever varying ever pleasing beauty <space> to erie <space> after which the highway becomes hardly so good <space> twenty four hours after entering pennsylvania <space> i make my exit across the boundary <space>
<space> is popularly believed by many of its numerous local admirers <space> to be the highest navigable lake in the world <space> if so however <space> lake tahoe <space> in the sierra nevada mountains comes next <space>
<space> the western half is kept in rather poor repair these days <space> but from fremont eastward <space> it is splendid wheeling <space> the atmosphere of bellevue is blue with politics <space> and myself and another innocent unsuspecting individual hailing from new york <space>
<space> a remnant of some indian tribe still lingers around here <space> and gathers huckleberries for the market <space> two squaws being in the village purchasing supplies for their camp in the swamps <space> what's the name of these indians here i ask <space>
<space> the woman a crimson crested blonde <space> jogs serenely along without even deigning to turn her head <space> leaving the bicycle at isham's who volunteers some slight repairs <space>
<space> is half buried in hot dust <space> the blackberries <space> are dead on the bushes <space> and the long suffering corn looks as though afflicted with the <space> yellow jaundice <space>
<space> the ohio regiments could out yell the louisiana tigers or any other confederate troops <space> two to one <space> who has not heard the ohio yell <space> most people are magnanimously inclined to regard this rumor as simply a gag on the buckeye boys <space>
<space> and in its fair bosom reflects beautiful landscape views <space> that are changed and rebeautified by the master hand of the sun every hour of the day <space> and doubly embellished at night by the moon <space> it is whispered that during the late <space> unpleasantness <space>
<space> surely this youngster's head <space> ought to be level on agricultural affairs when he grows up <space> if anybody's ought <space> from napoleon my route leads up the maumee river and canal <space> first trying the tow path <space> of the latter and then relinquishing it for <space>
<space> where from the little hamlet of springfield the roads become good <space> then better <space> and finally best <space> at girard <space> the home of the veteran showman dan rice <space> the beautifying works of whose generous hand are everywhere visible in his native town <space>
<space> by the most audaciously indifferent woman in the world <space> a market woman homeward bound with her empty truck wagon <space> recognizes my road rights to the extent of barely room to squeeze past between her wagon and the ditch <space>
<space> both sides of which are lined with magnificent farms <space> whose fields and meadows fairly groan beneath their wealth of produce <space> whose fructiferous orchards <space> arc marvels <space> of productiveness <space>
<space> show you the stock <space> and never tire of talking <space> about the hundreds <space> ay thousands <space> of horses <space> and horned cattle <space> seen roaming over the pastures <space> of the plantation <space>
<space> it mattered not to maurice gerald <space> who now clear of every entanglement <space> became the husband of the fair creole <space> after a visit to his native land <space> including the european tour <space>
<space> and what a poor compensation it seemed to those who had taken part in exacting it <space> as they stood gazing upon the remains of the villain <space> and his victim <space> the swarth ruffian dangling from the branch above <space>
<space> the title would have counted for little <space> nor did its owner care to carry it <space> but by a bit of good fortune <space> not always attendant on an irish baronetcy <space>
<space> with the mental <space> and corporeal excitement <space> long sustained <space> did not fail to produce its effect <space> and <space> the mind of maurice gerald once more returned to its delirious dreaming <space>
<space> the gift of her who alone could have secured it such a place <space> turned aside the shot <space> causing it to ricochet <space> not harmlessly however <space>
<space> both <space> still this side of middle life <space> residing under their roof <space> you would find an old gentleman of aristocratic air and venerable aspect <space> withal chatty <space> and cheerful <space> who would conduct you around the corrales <space>
<space> which instead of a <space> nobody <space> gave him a nobleman for his son <space> such in reality was <space> sir <space> maurice gerald <space> erst known as <space> maurice the mustanger <space> in texas <space>
<space> who has full charge of the horses <space> the other <space> a coachman of sable skin <space> yclept <space> pluto poindexter <space> who would scorn to look at a horse <space> except when perched upon the box <space>
<space> a sadness independent of that caused by the spectacle of a murder <space> it was regret <space> at having so hastily despatched the assassin <space> beautiful <space> even in death <space> was isidora <space> such features as she possessed <space>
<space> dealt out summary chastisement by hanging him to a tree <space> it was not cruelty <space> only a crude kind of justice <space> an eye for an eye <space> and a tooth for a tooth <space>
<space> in a jail <space> where he was scarce cared for at all <space> when again restored to consciousness <space> it was to discover that the fair vision of his dreams <space> was no vision at all <space> but a lovely woman <space>
<space> florinda now the better half of his life has <space> effected the transformation <space>
<space> and back only <space> after you have retired <space> but the huge gobbler <space> seen in the smoke house <space>
<space> do not reproach the young creole because this passion <space> was paramount in her soul <space> do not blame her for feeling pleasure amidst moments <space> that should otherwise have been devoted to sadness <space>
<space> the spirit of the aristocratic planter <space> steeped in sorrow <space> and humiliated by misfortune <space> had become purged <space> of its false pride <space> though it needed not this to make him willingly acquiesce in an alliance <space>
<space> but no longer lay his body in danger <space> in the chapparal surrounded by wolves and shadowed by soaring vultures <space> in a hut <space> where he was but ill attended <space>
<space> nowhere has it effected greater changes than <space> in texas during the last decade <space> and especially <space>
<space> had been true enough <space> he must have felt sure of it <space> before turning the muzzle towards his own temples <space> and firing the bullet <space> that had lodged in his brain <space>
<space> covarubio <space> de los llanos <space> as the spirit of the unhappy senorita <space> passed into eternity <space>
<space> she joyed to see the latter led back at the end of a lazo <space> held in the hand of her husband <space> and refused to interfere <space> when a band of regulators <space> called hastily together <space>
<space> diaz <space> it was the last utterance of <space>
<space> right over the heart <space> he had hit his intended victim <space> and through the heart <space> would the leaden missile have made its way <space>
<space> and the fair form <space> lying underneath <space> the hearts of the texans were touched <space> as perhaps <space> they had never been before <space> there was a strange thought passing through their minds <space>
<space> it carried along with it an endowment <space> ample enough to clear casa del corvo of the mortgage <space> held by the late cassius calhoun <space> and claimed by his nearest of kin <space> this was not woodley poindexter <space>
<space> nor that her happiness was heightened on learning from the astonished spectators <space> how her lover's life <space> had been preserved <space> as it might seem <space> miraculously <space> the aim of the assassin <space>
<space> and after having the ribbons deftly delivered into his hands <space> since we last saw him <space> the gay pluto <space> has become <space> tamed down to a staid and sober benedict <space> black <space> though he be <space>
<space> for <space> after calhoun's death it was discovered <space> that the ex captain <space> had once been a benedict <space> and there was a young scion of his stock living in new orleans <space> who had the legal right <space> to say he was his son <space>
<space> you would become the recipient of a hospitality <space> unequalled in european lands <space> you would have for your host <space> one of the handsomest men in texas <space> for your hostess <space> one of its most beautiful women <space>
who can blame her for giving way to the subdued happiness that succeeded <space> not i <space> not you <space> if you <space> speak truly <space> the passion that controlled her <space> may not be popular under a strictly puritan standard <space>
<space> universal <space> and irresistible <space> telling us that father <space> mother sister and brother <space> are all to be forsaken <space> for that love illimitable <space>
<space> take possession of her spirit <space> and then only in the shape of a shadow soon to pass away <space> it was one day when her husband came home to the hacienda <space> bearing in his arms <space> the body <space> of a beautiful woman <space>
<space> leaving him for a time <space> you would come in contact with <space> two other individuals attached to the establishment <space> one is the groom <space> of the stole <space> by name <space> phelim o'neal <space>
<space> not <space> yet dead <space> though the blood streaming from a wound in her bared bosom <space> showed she had not long to live <space> to the question <space> who has done this <space> she was only able to answer <space> diaz <space>
<space> at length <space> going with thoughts not altogether sacred <space> in the physical world <space> time is accounted the destroyer <space> though in the moral <space> it is oft the restorer <space>
<space> plantations have sprung up <space> where late the chapparal thickly covered the earth <space> and cities stand <space> where <space> the wild steed once roamed over a pathless <space> prairie <space>
<space> whose story <space> she now better comprehended <space> she even assisted her lord in the saddling of his red bay steed <space> and encouraged him in the pursuit of the assassin <space>
<space> louise poindexter <space> lady gerald <space> she must now be called <space> during her sojourn in the <space> emerald isle saw nothing to excite her to jealousy <space> only once again did this fell passion <space>
<space> the domestics will tell it you <space> but only in whispers <space> since they know that it is a theme tabooed by the master and mistress of the mansion <space> in whom <space> it excites sad souvenirs <space> it is the story <space>
<space> it would seem as if heaven's wrath was acting in concert with the passions of <space> earth <space> maurice gerald <space> is no longer the cynosure of those scowling eyes <space> he has been clamorously acquitted <space>
<space> either about the murder <space> or its motive <space> and the prisoner is spared further description of that fiendish <space> deed that left the dead body of henry poindexter <space> without a head <space>
<space> after what i've confessed it would be folly in me to expect <space> pardon <space> and i don't <space> i've been a bad fellow <space> and no doubt have done enough to deserve my fate <space> but bad as i may have been <space>
<space> this is the only change observable <space> the judge is the same <space> the jury the same <space> and the spectators as before <space> though with very different feelings in regard to the criminality of the accused <space>
<space> it is now evening <space> and the sunbeams falling aslant intrude upon the space canopied by the tree <space> from the golden brightness displayed by them at noon <space>
<space> while speaking he has kept his right hand under the left breast of his coat <space> along with the oath it comes forth <space> holding a revolver <space> the spectators have just time to see the pistol <space>
<space> when on the faces that encircle him he sees not one wearing an expression of sympathy <space> there is not even pity <space> all appear to frown upon him <space>
<space> and fatal to a friend <space> it was sure enough <space> and <space> poor henry dropped from his horse <space>
<space> the speaker rests his eye <space>
<space> and is henceforth <space> only one of the witnesses <space> in the place late occupied by him another stands <space> cassius calhoun <space> is now the prisoner <space> at the bar <space>
<space> and he has been condemned <space> the trial has come to a close <space> the verdict <space> guilty has been given <space> and the judge <space> laying aside his panama hat <space> is about to put on the black <space> cap <space>
<space> for all this <space> it is remarked as singular that a storm should be coming at the time <space> since it symbolises the sentiment of the spectators <space> who look on with sullenness in their hearts <space> and gloom in their glances <space>
he starts at the invitation <space> falling as it does like a death knell <space> upon his ear <space> he looks wildly around <space> despairingly <space>
<space> as if there was anger in the sky <space> it is but an accident of the atmosphere <space> the portent <space> of an approaching storm <space>
<space> imputation of having murdered my own cousin <space> i did take his life <space> as i've <space> told you <space> you are all asking why <space> and conjecturing about the motive <space> there was none <space>
<space> must have ensued <space> almost instantaneously after his receiving the shot <space> why should cassius calhoun have killed his own cousin <space> why cut off his head <space> no one can answer these questions <space>
<space> you know all that's passed <space> but not what's to come <space>
who only answers with a look so calm <space> as almost to betray indifference <space> yes <space> i intended to kill <space> him <space> i had my reasons i'm not going to say what they were <space> it's no use now <space>
<space> on the edge of an eternity <space> too terrible to contemplate <space> to a conscience like his <space> it cannot be otherwise than appalling <space> all at once <space> a light is seen <space> to flask into his eyes <space>
<space> you see me standing on my grave <space>
<space> for so stands the assassin <space> in texas <space> his demeanour <space> is completely changed <space>
<space> shot him <space> dead in the chapparal <space>
<space> that dread emblem of death <space> preparatory to pronouncing the sentence <space> in the <space> usual solemn manner the condemned man is invited to make his final speech <space> to avail himself as it were <space>
<space> sunken as they are in the midst of <space> two livid circles <space> he has the air of one on the eve of making confession <space> is it to be an acknowledgment of guilt <space>
<space> a new sensation makes itself manifest among the spectators <space> it partakes of surprise <space> curiosity and incredulity <space> no one speaks <space> or in any way attempts interruption <space>
<space> save the murderer himself <space> no one expects him to do so <space> save to his maker <space> before him he must soon stand <space> for a knowledge of the motive is <space> not deemed essential to his condemnation <space>
<space> oft exhibited in bold brutal <space> bullyism he looks cowed and craven <space> and not strange that he should <space> he feels that there is no chance of escape <space> that he is standing by the side of his coffin <space>
his confederates <space> those payed ruffians <space> who have hitherto supported him <space> are of no use now <space> and their sympathy of no consequence <space> they have shrunk out of sight <space>
<space> is he about to unburden his conscience <space> of the weight <space> that must be on it <space> the spectators <space> guessing his intention stand breathlessly observing him <space> there is silence <space> even among the cicadas <space>
<space> you wonder at that <space> it's easily explained <space> i killed him by mistake <space> the surprise culminates in a shout <space> suppressed as the speaker proceeds <space> yes <space> by mistake <space>
<space> it has been established beyond the shadow of a doubt <space> the evidence is already before them <space> and though entirely circumstantial as in most cases of murder <space> the circumstances form a chain <space> irresistibly conclusive and complete <space>
<space> once more in their midst <space> beyond these sounds <space> soon ceasing there is nothing to hinder the confession from being continued <space> i know that i've got to die <space> proceeds the prisoner <space> with an air of seeming recklessness <space>
<space> and god knows i was sorry enough <space> on discovering that i had made it <space> i didn't know myself till long after <space> the condemned man looks up <space> as if in hopes that he has touched a chord of mercy <space>
<space> for the testimony of gerald has been confirmed by a subsequent examination of the dead body <space> the surgeon of the cantonment has pronounced the two distinct <space> and that henry poindexter's death <space>
<space> before the majesty of the law <space> and the damning evidence of his guilt <space> despite his social standing and the wealth <space> to sustain it he sees himself alone without friend or sympathiser <space>
<space> as it glints under the slanting sunbeams <space> when two shots are heard in quick succession <space> with a like interval between two men fall forward upon their faces and lie with their heads <space> closely contiguous <space>
<space> continues he <space> i needn't <space> that i intended to kill some one <space> i did <space> nor am i going to deny who it was <space> it was the cur i see standing before me <space> in a glance of concentrated hatred <space>
<space> the crowd closes around believing both to be dead <space>
<space> there is no sign of it <space> on the faces that surround him <space> still solemnly austere <space>
<space> there is but one missing link <space> if <space> link it may be called <space> the motive <space> the motive both for the murder <space> and the mutilation <space>
<space> till i've sent <space> him to his <space> i don't <space> by god <space> there is no need to guess at the meaning of this profane speech the last of calhoun's life <space> its meaning is made clear by the act that accompanies it <space>
<space> it is broken by the formalised interrogatory of the judge <space> have you anything to say why sentence of death should not be pronounced upon you <space> no <space> he replies <space> i have not <space>
<space> the jury has given a just verdict <space> i acknowledge that i have forfeited my life <space> and deserve to lose it <space>
<space> and expresses horror rather than indignation <space> alike involuntary is the groan that goes with it <space> proceeding from <space> a single individual whom all know to be the father of the murdered man <space>
<space> and looked into the church <space> through a little window at one side of the pulpit <space> for this he started <space> but he did not fail to run across the square <space> and leap over the church gate at the top of his speed <space>
<space> in a tremulous <space> but very kind voice <space> give your master the christmas blessing of an old puritan minister <space> how the meaning of this message would have been known to mister dudley <space> had not the events we have told <space> disclosed it <space>
<space> but half recovered from his wonder <space> he was just raising his voice to utter a remonstrance <space> when to his sevenfold amazement <space> the door was opened <space> to the knock <space> and the old man disappeared within <space>
<space> in returning home <space> he had to pass along the rather <space> unfrequented street <space> which runs in the rear of his church and close to it <space> as he was driving rapidly along <space> his ear caught what seemed <space> the peal of an organ <space>
<space> so he went back to his shop <space> and sat looking upon the church <space> and watching <space> almost with dread <space> the doves that lighted upon its roof <space> and fluttered about and beat <space> their wings against its windows <space>
<space> it was not until nathan stoddard <space> had looked for some little time upon this spectacle <space> that he began to feel that he was witness <space> of any thing more than natural <space> the whole party had <space> so home like an air <space>
<space> rose high and loud <space> while a great thundering at the front door of the church <space> announced <space> that the people below had also caught the sound of the music <space> and were clamorous for admission <space>
<space> he stopped his horse to listen <space>
<space> the minister of nathan's parish <space> was a young man by the name of dudley <space> and it so happened <space> that he had driven out before light <space> on the morning we have spoken of <space> to visit a sick man at some distance <space>
<space> although a good deal stooping <space> with long straight <space> and very white <space> hair falling over his shoulders <space> which was the more conspicuous <space> from the black velvet cap <space> as it appeared that he wore <space>
<space> as to who the stranger could be <space> when he beheld him turn in <space> between the posts by the path <space> that leads to the church <space> tread lightly over the snow <space> and up the steps <space> and knock hastily and vigorously at the church door <space>
<space> and followed in silence <space> nathan sprang upon the shed at the side of the church <space> and scrambled up to the little window <space> mister dudley followed <space> and with nathan's help <space> gained the same precarious foothold <space> look in sir <space>
<space> he was leaning over the great bible <space> with his hands folded upon it <space> and his eyes <space> seemingly filled with tears of pleasure and gratitude <space> and bent upon the choir <space> mister dudley listened <space> intently <space>
<space> and crowded with people whom his eye versed in the dress and manners of our forefathers <space> recognized as <space> the church goers of a century and a half ago <space> the singers gallery was filled by a choir of girls and boys <space>
<space> the more he was filled for all their appearance of youth <space> and their simple manners <space> with a strange sort of veneration <space> the sweet and cheerful faces <space> of the young women seemed to grow awfully calm <space>
<space> until he felt <space> that he was near swooning <space> and like to fall <space> and he clung desperately to his hold <space> when the fit was over he dared venture no more <space> but hastened <space> to the ground <space>
<space> in order to gather warmth and courage for the attempt <space> when nathan stoddard climbed upon the old shed <space> and pressed his <space> face against the glass of the little church window <space> he had at first <space> only a confused impression <space>
<space> and beautiful as they brought <space> their task to a close <space> and their foreheads <space> with the hair brought back in the old fashioned way <space> to become more and more serene and high <space> there was a strange beauty too <space>
<space> said nathan <space> not venturing <space> a glance himself <space> mister dudley looked <space> and had not nathan's arm been about his body he would have lost his hold in sheer amazement <space> the building was crowded as he had never known it <space> before <space>
<space> it was said to be a portrait of a minister in the town <space> who lived in the last century <space> and is still remembered for his virtues <space> the sight of this old man's face completely stilled the agitation of the young minister <space>
<space> and fastened him to a post before the door <space> then stepping to the side of the sleigh <space> he said to mister dudley <space> come with me sir <space> mister dudley looked upon the pale face <space> and trembling lips of his parishioner <space>
which nathan attends <space> stands in the same square with his shop <space> and nearly opposite <space> it was closed as usual on christmas day <space> and a recent snow had heaped the steps and roof <space> and loaded the windows <space>
<space> as he <space> glared <space> through the darkness into the old kirk of alloway <space> the great chandelier of the church was partly lighted <space> and there were besides <space> many candles and lanterns burning in different parts of the room <space>
<space> it was not without a creeping feeling of <space> awe <space> mingled with his astonishment <space> that nathan gazed upon the door <space> through which this silent figure had vanished <space> but he was not easily to be daunted <space>
<space> and drove round into the square to the shop of nathan stoddard <space> there is music to day in our church nathan <space> he cried to the young saddler <space> what can it mean <space> but nathan answered not a word <space> he caught the horse by the head <space>
<space> had been fairly dressed for christmas by spirit <space> hands <space> when mister dudley reached his home <space> after the wonder had in part spent itself <space> he found that an enormous christmas pie <space>
<space> hastening to begin his work <space> the town is an old fashioned one <space> and although the observance of the ancient church festival <space> is no longer frowned upon <space> as in years past <space> yet it has been little regarded <space>
<space> mister dudley hastened round to prevent <space> their causing any disturbance to the congregation within <space> but he came only in time to see the door burst open <space> and to be borne in with the crowd <space> all gazed about in wonder <space>
<space> by this time the sound of <space> a gathering crowd below which he had not heeded at first <space> was forced more and more upon his notice <space> and the anxious voice of his oldest deacon calling <space> mister dudley <space> mister dudley <space>
<space> nathan thought <space> that it looked <space> uncommonly beautiful <space> in the softening twilight of the morning <space> while nathan stood musing <space> with his eyes fixed upon the church <space>
<space> about the old man's face <space> he appeared to nathan <space> as if he felt that the group before him <space> only waited his command to fade away <space> in the morning light <space> that struggled among the candles <space> but he could not bear to give the word <space>
<space> that he could not forbear standing without the door for a moment <space> as if to enjoy the triumph <space> of the warmth within him <space> over the cold morning air <space> the little stone church <space>
<space> who were dressed in breeches and ruffled shirts <space> and hooped petticoats <space> and towering head dresses <space> such as he had only seen in old pictures <space> they were mounted upon benches and ladders <space>
<space> he did not care to follow the steps of the stranger into the church <space> but he remembered a shed <space> so placed against the building <space> near the farther end <space> that he had often when a child <space> at some peril indeed <space> climbed upon its top <space>
<space> that led nathan stoddard <space> to keep secret what he had witnessed <space> but it was like some deep and holy experience <space>
<space> and so they kept playing <space> with the festoons and stepping about the pews to please <space> him <space> nathan felt a cold thrill <space> partly from pleasure <space> and partly from awe <space> running up his back <space> and a strong pain across his forehead <space>
<space> especially in the church <space> of which nathan <space> is a member <space> as the saddler mounted the steps of his shop <space> he felt the blood so rush along his limbs <space> and tingle in his fingers <space>
<space> the whole party appeared full <space> of life and cheerfulness <space> while the old man whom nathan had seen enter stood near the door <space> looking quietly on <space> with a little girl holding his hand <space>
<space> and boards laid <space> along the tops of the pews <space> and were apparently just completing the decoration of the church <space> which was already dressed with green <space> with little trees in the corners <space> and with green letters upon the walls <space>
<space> had been left at his door <space> by a white haired old man dressed in black <space> about six in the morning <space> just after he had gone to visit <space> his sick parishioner <space> the girl who received it reported the old man as saying <space>
<space> and that he avows the intention of observing the christmas <space> of the following year with public services <space> unless indeed <space> he should be anticipated by his <space> ancient predecessor <space>
<space> and the serene color grandeur <space> of the morning and evening sky <space> in summer you find the groves and gardens in full dress <space> glaciers melting rapidly under sunshine and rain <space> waterfalls <space> in all their glory <space>
<space> where it has escaped fire and snow avalanches <space> there is another handsome spruce <space> hereabouts <space> picea alba <space> very slender and graceful in habit <space> drooping at the top <space> like a mountain hemlock <space>
<space> then with a man holding down his shoulders <space> we succeeded in getting the bone into its socket <space> notwithstanding the inflammation <space> and contraction of the muscles and ligaments <space> mister young was then put to bed <space> and he slept all the way back to wrangell <space>
<space> though most of them <space> are comparatively short <space> as their highest <space> sources <space> lie in the icy solitudes of the range within forty or fifty miles of the coast <space> a few however <space> of these foaming roaring streams <space>
<space> at a distance of about seven or eight miles to the northeastward <space> of the landing there is an outstanding group of mountains crowning <space> a spur from the main chain of the coast <space> range <space> whose highest point rises about <space>
<space> i marched him slowly down in the starlight <space> on the comparatively smooth <space>
<space> was once united front to front <space> with the greater glacier <space> though at first both were tributaries <space> of the main stickeen glacier <space> which once filled the whole grand canyon <space> after the main <space> trunk <space> canyon was melted out <space>
<space> of form and sculpture <space> and are wonderfully adorned and enlivened with glaciers and waterfalls <space> while throughout almost its whole extent <space> the floor is a flowery landscape <space> garden <space> like yosemite <space>
<space> from miles of wild roses clover and honeysuckle <space> the swaths of birch and willow on the lower slopes <space> following the melting of the winter <space> avalanche snow banks <space>
<space> cirques and branch <space> canyons <space> along the tops and sides of the walls <space> the indians have a tradition that the river used <space> to run <space> through a tunnel under the united fronts of the two large tributary glaciers mentioned above <space>
<space> the sunbeams <space> streaming through the ice pinnacles <space> along its terminal wall produced a wonderful glory of color <space> and the broad sparkling crystal prairie and the distant snowy fountains were wonderfully attractive <space>
<space> while he went on down the river about his business <space> but when he heard my call for help <space> he hastened forward and elbowed the divines away from the end of the gangplank <space> shouting in angry irreverence <space> oh blank <space> this is no time for preaching <space>
<space> and sometimes to telegraph <space> creek <space> fifteen miles farther <space> it first pursues <space> a westerly course <space> through grassy plains darkened here and there with groves <space> of spruce and pine <space>
<space> eight thousand feet above the level of the sea <space> and as glenora is only a <space> thousand feet above the sea <space>
<space> that line the banks of the rivers <space> or even stretching all the way across the main canyons <space> compelling the rivers to find a channel beneath them <space> the stickeen was <space> perhaps the best known of the rivers that cross the coast range <space>
<space> of those deep <space> accumulations of mosses <space> leaves and decaying trunks <space> which make so damp and unclearable mass <space> in the coast <space> forests <space>
<space> we reached the old hudson's bay trading post at glenora <space> about one o'clock <space> and the captain informed me that he would stop here <space> until the next morning <space> when he would make an early start for wrangell <space>
<space> the river rejoicing in its strength <space> young birds trying their wings bears enjoying salmon and berries <space> all the life of the canyon brimming full like <space> the streams <space> in autumn comes rest <space> as if the year's work were done <space>
<space> the bossy <space> cumuli swelling in white and purple piles <space> above the highest peaks <space> gray rain clouds wreathing <space> the outstanding brows and battlements of the walls <space>
<space> and the breaking forth of the sun after the rain <space> the shining of the leaves and streams and crystal architecture of the glaciers <space> the rising of fresh fragrance <space> the song of <space> the happy birds <space>
<space> i reached up <space> took hold of him by one of his feet and gently slid him down on his back <space>
<space> i reminded him <space> of the roughness of the way <space> his nerve shaken condition <space> and assured him i would not be gone long <space> but he insisted on trying <space>
<space> the most striking features are the glaciers <space> hanging over the cliffs <space> descending <space> the side canyons and pushing forward <space> to the river <space> greatly enhancing <space> the wild beauty <space> of all the others <space>
<space> and the glacier was reached perhaps about midnight <space> here i took off one of my boots <space> tied a handkerchief around his wrist for a good hold <space>
<space> at a considerable angle <space> i briefly explained to mister young's companions <space> who stood looking down at us <space> that he had been hurt in an accident <space> and requested one of them to assist me in getting him aboard <space> but strange to say instead of coming down to help <space>
<space> my first trip up the river was made in the spring <space> with the missionary party soon after our arrival at wrangell <space> we left wrangell in the afternoon and anchored for the night above the river delta <space>
<space> dug heel notches and slid him down to them <space>
<space> and had receded to a greater or lesser height <space> above the valley floor <space> the big stickeen glacier is hardly out of sight <space> ere you come <space> upon another <space> that pours a majestic crystal flood <space>
<space> we arrived before noon <space> at the old trading post called buck's <space> in front of the stickeen glacier <space> and remained long enough to allow the few passengers <space> who wished <space> a nearer view to cross the river <space> to the terminal moraine <space>
<space> because of the advantageous position <space> it occupied for general views of the peaks and glaciers <space> of the east side of the great range <space> although it was now twenty minutes past three and the days were getting short <space>
<space> the most interesting of the short excursions we made from fort wrangell <space> was the one up the stickeen river <space> to the head of steam navigation <space> from mt saint elias <space> the coast range extends <space> in a broad lofty chain <space>
<space> and expands in a broad fan <space> five or six miles in width <space> separated <space> from the stickeen river by its broad <space> terminal moraine <space> fringed with spruces and willows <space> around the beautifully drawn curve of the moraine <space>
<space> the rocks also <space> and the glaciers <space> seem to bloom <space> like the plants in the mellow golden light <space> and so goes the song <space> change succeeding change in sublime harmony <space> through all the wonderful seasons and weather <space>
<space> and a leafy <space> bed beside it <space> i now told him i would run down the mountain <space> hasten back with help from the boat <space> and carry him down in comfort <space> but he would not hear of my leaving him <space> no no he said <space> i can walk down don't leave me <space>
<space> well i have warned you i said <space> and will not assume responsibility <space> for any trouble that may arise <space> he proved to be a stout walker <space> and we made rapid progress <space> across a brushy <space> timbered flat <space>
<space> and you have no right to risk your life on treacherous peaks and precipices <space>
<space> on the opposite side of the river <space> there is a group <space> of <space> five glaciers <space> one of them descending to within a hundred feet <space> of the river <space> near glenora <space> on the northeastern flank <space> of the main coast range <space>
<space> taku <space> stickeen <space> and perhaps others <space> head beyond the range <space> with some of the southwest branches <space> of the mackenzie and yukon <space> the largest side branches <space>
<space> through the evergreens while almost every hollow and tributary canyon contains <space> a smaller one <space> the size of course varying with the extent of the area drained <space> some are like mere snow banks <space> others with the blue ice apparent <space>
<space> which entered the main canyon from either side <space> and that on one occasion an indian anxious to get rid of his wife <space> had her sent adrift in a canoe down <space> through the ice tunnel <space> expecting <space> that she would trouble him no more <space>
when we were near a cluster of crumbling pinnacles that formed the summit <space> i had ceased <space> to feel anxiety about the mountaineering strength and skill of my companion <space> and pushed rapidly on <space> in passing around the shoulder of the highest pinnacle <space>
<space> to make sure that it was not <space> interrupted by sheer precipices <space> i concluded <space> that with great care <space> and the digging of slight footholds <space> he could be slid down to the glacier <space> where i could lay him on his back and perhaps be able to set his arms <space>
<space> and are composed of smaller trees about a foot <space> to eighteen inches in diameter <space> and seventy five feet high <space> mostly two leaved <space> pines <space> which hold their seeds for several years after they are ripe <space> the woods here are without a trace <space>
<space> i saw fine specimens <space> a hundred and twenty five feet high <space> on deep <space> bottom land <space> a few miles below glenora <space> the tops of some of them <space> were almost covered with dense clusters of yellow and brown cones <space>
<space> and succeeded in getting one of his arms into place <space>
<space> beyond the southern boundary of the territory <space> gashed by stupendous canyons <space>
<space> because it was the best way to the mackenzie river <space> cassiar gold mines <space> it is about three hundred and fifty miles long <space> and is navigable for small steamers <space> a hundred and fifty miles <space> to glenora <space>
<space> the rich hazy sunshine streaming over the cliffs calls forth <space> the last of the gentians and goldenrods <space> the groves and thickets and meadows bloom again <space> as their leaves change to red and yellow petals <space>
<space> i therefore bound it closely to his side <space> and asked him if in his exhausted and trembling condition he was <space> still able to walk <space> yes <space> he bravely replied <space> so with a steadying arm around him and many stops for rest <space>
<space> depend in massive bulging curves and swells <space> and graduate into the river like forms <space> that maze through the lower forested regions <space> and are so striking and beautiful <space> that they are admired even by the passing miners <space>
<space> and deposited on the first <space> open levels below <space> here too occurs a marked change in climate and consequently <space> in forests and general appearance of the face of the country <space> on account of destructive fires <space> the woods are younger <space>
<space> then curving southward <space> and receiving numerous tributaries from the north <space> it enters the coast range <space> and sweeps across it <space> through <space> a magnificent canyon <space> three thousand to five thousand feet <space> deep <space>
<space> gliding along the swift <space> flowing river the views change <space> with bewildering <space> rapidity <space> wonderful too <space> are the changes dependent on the seasons <space> and the weather <space> in spring when the snow is melting fast <space>
where the rock was rapidly disintegrating <space> and the danger of slipping was great i <space> shouted in a warning voice <space> be very careful here <space> this is dangerous <space> mister young was perhaps a dozen or two yards behind me <space> but out of sight <space>
<space> had been swearing in angry impatience for being compelled to make so late a start <space> and thus encounter a dangerous wind in <space> a narrow gorge <space> and was threatening to put the missionaries ashore to seek their lost companion <space>
<space> and up the mountain slopes <space> open in some places <space> and in others <space> thatched with dwarf firs <space> resting a minute here and there to refresh ourselves with huckleberries <space> which grew in abundance in open spots <space> about half an hour before sunset <space>
<space> are still occupied by glaciers which descend in showy ranks <space> their messy <space> bulging snouts <space> lying back <space> a little distance in the shadows of the walls <space> or pushing forward <space> among the cotton woods <space>
<space> i thought that by rapid climbing i could reach the summit before sunset <space> in time to get a general view and a few pencil sketches <space> and make my way back to the steamer in the night <space> mister young one of the missionaries asked permission to <space> accompany me <space>
<space> a distance of perhaps a mile <space> crossed the moraine bathed his head at one of the outlet streams <space> and after many rests reached a dry place <space> and made a brush fire <space> i then went ahead looking for an open way <space>
<space> with gold dust in their eyes <space> thirty five miles above the big stickeen glacier <space> is the dirt glacier <space> the second in size <space> its outlet <space> is a fine stream <space> abounding <space> in trout <space>
<space> where the forest <space> has been utterly destroyed <space> the river bank cottonwoods <space> are also smaller <space> and the birch <space> and <space> contorta pines <space> mingle freely with the coast <space> hemlock <space> and spruce <space> the birch is common on the lower slopes <space>
<space> i found however that this was impossible in such a place <space> i therefore tied his arms to his sides with my suspenders <space> and necktie <space> to prevent as much as possible inflammation from movement <space> i then left him <space> telling him <space> to lie still <space>
<space> a fair day's work <space> for a seasoned mountaineer to be done in less <space> than half a day <space> and part of a night <space> but he insisted that he was a strong walker <space> could do a mountaineer's day's work in half a day <space> and would not hinder me in any way <space>
<space> they made haste <space> to reproach him for having gone on a wild goose chase with muir <space> these foolish adventures are well enough for mister muir they said <space> but you mister young <space> have <space> a work to do <space> you have a family <space> you have a church <space>
<space> and made him lean on my shoulder while i steadied him to prevent his falling <space> this slow staggering struggle from fire to fire lasted until long after sunrise <space> when at last we reached the ship and stood <space> at the foot <space> of the narrow single plank <space>
<space> but to his surprise she floated through under the ice in safety <space> all the evidence connected with the present appearance <space> of these two glaciers indicates <space> that they were united and formed a dam across the river <space>
<space> and is very effective <space> its round <space> leafy pale green head contrasting with the dark narrow spires <space> of the conifers and giving a striking character to the forest <space> the tamarac pine <space> or black pine <space> as the variety of <space>
<space> you enjoy the countless rejoicing waterfalls <space> the gentle breathing of warm winds <space> the colors of the young leaves and flowers when the bees are busy <space> and wafts of fragrance are drifting hither <space> and thither <space>
<space> just below a narrow gorge called the canyon <space> terraces <space> first make <space> their appearance <space> where great quantities of moraine material <space> have been <space> swept <space> through the flood <space> choked gorge <space> and of course outspread <space>
<space> why not dress a part and walk away <space> incognito <space> oh <space> certainly <space> assented the other with <space> bitterness <space> put on a suit of tights and dive out of the conservatory window disguised as annette kellerman i suppose <space>
<space> the eluder of justice eyed them and drew his own conclusions <space> here we are <space> all of us <space> he said to himself <space> retiring discreetly behind his newspaper <space>
<space> the two gentlemen then moved away in the extinguished taxi <space> tickets had been provided by the forethoughtful harmon <space> the fugitive was the first man in the parlor car <space>
<space> easily <space> i'm not a manufacturer of chemicals for nothing <space> great <space> keep it going for ten seconds for the benefit of the watchful murphy <space> and if you look up after that <space>
<space> plumb in the dead center of nowhere <space> thirteen miles from a railroad <space> fishing and hunting on the premises <space> reads like a real estate man's prospectus <space> observed remsen <space> this year <space> pursued harmon <space>
<space> tested it at every point <space> and pronounced it perfect <space> but <space> we've forgotten one point <space> said remsen at the end of the discussion <space> what's that <space> where do i go when i get out <space> where do you want to go <space>
<space> they won't thank you when they meet across the dinner table <space> oh <space> it isn't as bad as that <space> they'll be a mile apart <space> the lees will be at the cottage <space> they get off at meredith and go in on the truck <space> the woods i'm sending to the island <space>
<space> they climb out at ashland and go over by boat <space> unless they all happen to take the same train <space> one pair won't even know the other is around until they meet up on the lake or in the woods <space> sounds like a party <space> doesn't it <space> want to join <space>
<space> i've got some things to attend to <space> now <space> about our jail breaking scheme <space> i've got an amendment <space> how would it be if the taxi i arrive in should catch fire at the psychological moment <space> can it be done <space>
<space> what's the matter with an old man makeup and <space> the front door <space> just this <space> friend murphy on watch hauls out his little paper <space> and on the chance of its being me <space> slaps the wrist of anybody who appears on those steps <space>
<space> perhaps you can tell me what's amiss with this beastly house <space> i'll tell you <space> proffered the obliging and innocent mister murphy <space> he did so <space> then i'll just go back and jolly well camp there till somebody jolly well lets me in <space>
him <space> i mean <space> and take him to the nine o'clock train for boulder brook in my taxi <space> right o old thing <space> be here at eight thirty <space> cheery o <space> said his host <space> britishly <space>
<space> when he was restored to his feet and his breath <space> and the taxi had ceased to imitate fafnir the dragon <space> a tall figure in an extremely english ulster <space> which had hastily emerged from the remsen front door <space> rushed down ten steps <space>
<space> i'm keeping open house for a special reason <space> two fellows i know are getting married to morrow <space> it's a double wedding <space> it's also a double honeymoon <space> but <space> they aren't onto that yet <space> harmon's clear brown eyes twinkled <space>
<space> to the cave <space> or the castle on the crags <space> or the haunted manor house <space> or the co educational club <space> or which one of the numerous institutions you maintain in your private city <space> she goes to the farmhouse <space>
<space> but the old bulldog of a butler won't let him put his nose inside the door <space> says his name is carteret <space> and he's come all the way from england to see him <space> england <space> not roddy carteret <space>
<space> and leisurely climbed them again <space> was wrenching violently at the bell <space> for a time mister murphy regarded him disdainfully <space> then crossed over <space> held brief colloquy <space> and returned <space> hot chance he's got of breaking in <space>
<space> from its window emerged a heavy puff of smoke <space> from its door <space> emerged <space> mister thomas harmon <space> who rolled upon the <space> pavement <space> apparently strangling <space> mister murphy rushed <space> to his aid <space>
<space> not yet <space> care to try <space> what does the thing look like <space> cast your eyes toward the avenue and you'll see one <space>
<space> decided the caller <space> argument followed while the chauffeur burrowed into the mechanism of his car <space> it ended by the englishman bestowing two dollars upon mister murphy <space> to get a message to mister remsen containing a protest and an address <space>
<space> five times mister thomas harmon vainly rang the bell of the remsen mansion <space> while engaged upon the sixth variation <space> he became aware of a face in the window <space> scrutinizing him <space> all right <space> called the face <space>
<space> i <space> get you <space> i'm to be in disguise <space> but <space> how shall we get the process server off guard <space> leave that <space> to me <space> the two conspirators elaborated their plan <space> built it up <space> revised it <space>
<space> fortified by my accent it is most convincing <space> that'll be <space> carteret <space> who <space> rodney carteret <space> am i supposed to know him <space> rather <space>
he observed <space> to mister harmon <space> what is he making all the fuss about <space> inquired that gentleman as the visitor again <space> applied himself forcefully to the bell <space> wants to see mister remsen <space>
<space> wouldn't know them if i did <space> any other agreeable surprises about the resort <space> no <space> oh <space> yes <space> i nearly forgot <space> there's a little friend of gloria greene's <space> girl <space> tired out <space>
<space> not know a man with whom you toured for two months in japan <space> said remsen <space> reproachfully <space> stupid of me <space> confessed harmon <space> grinning <space> carteret good old roddy <space> certainly <space> then i'd better capture you <space>
<space> missus bond my housekeeper is looking after her <space> seclusion is her watchword <space> if you see her <space> make a noise like a dry leaf and blow away <space> you'll go won't you <space> remsen meditated <space>
<space> merely a matter of distracting friend murphy's attention for ten seconds <space> at the end of the ten seconds you will be seen going up the steps to the front door <space>
<space> it was done almost as well as that accomplished actor mister jacob remsen <space> could have done it <space> harmon sprang across the street <space>
<space> presently you will be seen coming down again <space> unable to effect an entrance against the watchfulness of the faithful connor <space>
<space> get yourself a car from the garage and motor to the bungalow <space> that's at the third corner of my little triangular piece of mountain and forest <space>
<space> laid up <space> inquired mister harmon <space> shaking hands <space> bottled up <space> answered the young man <space> gloomily <space> can i help <space> possibly <space> did you ever kill a subpoena server <space>
<space> one half won't know how the other half lives till they get there <space> i've loaned the place to both couples for a fortnight <space> it's a dead secret <space> neither couple knows where the other is going <space> they're on oath <space>
<space> you'll see the englishest looking englishman you ever sat eyes on outside the pages of punch <space> trying to tear my old fashioned doorbell out by the roots <space> that's your best make up is it remsen <space>
he called <space> what on earth are you doing over here <space> the bell ringer adjusted a monocle <space> and ambled down the steps to shake hands <space>
<space> and were shown into drawing room <space> a <space> at the upper end of the car <space> shortly after <space> another couple <space> also glistening as to garb <space> entered and took possession of drawing room b <space> at the lower end of the car <space>
<space> it certainly seems made to order <space> and it's mighty good of you old man <space> yes <space> i'll just take you up on that <space> there's a train at nine o'clock in the morning <space> to morrow <space> make it the day after <space>
<space> too much gayety or something <space> don't know what it is or who she is but <space> she's up against it for a month's rest <space> so miss greene wished her on boulder brook <space> and welcome <space> where does she go <space> inquired remsen suspiciously <space>
<space> he never asks questions about other people's troubles <space> he now busied himself in thought <space> haven't you any of your amateur theatrical duds here <space> was the outcome of his cogitations <space> all of'em <space>
<space> he would have scorned to call it gossip <space> if there was any one thing in the world he hated <space> so he said <space> it was girls talk <space> this jabbering about nothing <space> for his part he wouldn't waste his time that way <space>
<space> said the practical edith <space> i don't believe you know a bit more about will hardon's bravery than you did before <space> we knew something about his manners <space> what <space> why <space> when he saw <space> where he was he didn't run away or flunk out <space>
<space> does julia wear glasses or look green <space> i beg your pardon brenda <space> no she doesn't <space> said nora shortly <space> she's about the nicest girl i know <space> oh <space> she is lovely <space> added edith <space>
<space> hastily interposed belle <space> boys never like a girl who studies <space> especially one who is going to college <space> well <space> julia is just the nicest girl <space> i know said nora <space> repeating the words she had used to philip <space>
<space> a matter of opinion <space> murmured belle <space> under her breath <space> you don't mean to say you haven't seen her <space> cried brenda <space> in surprise <space> no <space> i haven't happened to <space> answered philip <space>
<space> and everybody looking at him <space> oh <space> said one girl <space> and ah <space> said another <space> and <space> how silly <space> they all cried together <space> if girls amused themselves like that what fun you'd make of us <space> said the practical nora <space>
<space> oh it gives a fellow a chance to show what kind of stuff he's made of <space> explained philip <space> whether he has good manners and whether he's clever and all that <space> there must be better ways of showing bravery <space>
<space> and it was not often that he condescended to spend as long a time in their presence <space> as had been the case this afternoon <space> do you think that philip looks very well edith <space>
<space> i wasn't sorry <space> for the new york set is getting just <space> unbearable <space> i wouldn't so much mind fighting stanley hooper myself <space> about new york and boston <space> i guess i'd show him that new york isn't the whole world <space>
<space> i should say not <space> exclaimed nora <space> but belle who had some new york cousins <space> was silent <space> brenda however <space> noticing belle's expression <space> and not feeling disposed to side completely with nora <space> said <space>
<space> oh they hate to see these girls going about with books and <space> trying to get into harvard <space> yes <space> trying to break down the walls <space> said nora sarcastically <space>
<space> how funny you are <space> edith <space> said belle <space> you never hear anything <space> hasn't <space> anyone told you how the other fellows made him run blindfolded in his shirt sleeves down beacon street <space> no <space> really <space>
<space> so we can sit up late without thinking about school the next day <space> well <space> you'll see me sure <space> said philip <space> but see here it's five o'clock now and i have an engagement down town <space>
<space> how queer girls are <space> do you always fight like this when you're together <space> we don't fight like you boys <space> answered edith <space> good humoredly <space> we don't knock each other down and run the risk of breaking one another's noses <space>
<space> there was one good thing about the little disputes in which brenda and belle indulged <space> they very seldom lasted long <space> in the present instance <space> the girls were ashamed of having shown temper before philip <space>
<space> or stand on their heads in front of a pulpit for the sake of getting into the dicky <space> i tell you <space> we make some of them suffer <space>
<space> replied philip's sister <space> it seemed to me he was just a little pale <space> he is always pale <space> said edith <space> do you suppose he sits up too late <space> asked brenda <space> i'll warrant he doesn't study too much <space> said belle <space>
<space> you're terribly narrow nora <space> to think that nobody's any good unless he comes from boston <space> i didn't say so <space> replied nora <space> no <space> but that's what you mean <space> and i'm surprised philip blair <space>
<space> she's invited to my cooking party next week <space> said nora <space> you know that you've accepted too so you'll see her <space> oh yes by the way <space> said philip <space> what evening is it <space> friday of course replied nora <space>
<space> how can you criticise edith's brother <space> don't let her do it edith <space> it doesn't trouble me <space> answered the placid edith <space> i know all about philip and he's good enough for me <space> that's right said nora <space>
<space> oh see here it would just spoil everything to have women in the classes with us <space> are you afraid they'd get ahead of you <space> asked edith <space> gently <space> now look here edith <space>
<space> no <space> that's just it <space> you don't treat her decently <space>
<space> well <space> you'd better talk brenda barlow <space> broke in nora again <space> just see the way you treat julia <space> if she'd been born in boston <space> i <space> don't treat her <space> interrupted brenda <space>
<space> he says there are two or three fellows just sponging off of philip all the time <space> and philip is too good natured to say anything <space> i wonder how he'll like julia <space> said edith <space>
<space> he walked off as nice as you please <space> wasn't he mad at the two fellows for taking him there <space> of course not <space> that's a part of the thing <space> why <space> there are fellows in cambridge who would go through fire and water <space>
<space> he was a harvard sophomore and realized his own importance <space> quite as much as the girls did <space> but still there was always the chance that he would come into the room just for a minute <space> and tell them some of the latest cambridge news <space>
<space> although he had belonged to the illustrious organization <space> a very short time <space> well i <space> think you're perfectly horrid <space> cried brenda <space> i <space> mean the dicky <space> i've heard about the way you make people suffer <space> branding them with hot cigars and <space> making them run barefoot winter nights and <space>
<space> philip hurried off <space> bowing in a very grown up way to the group of girls <space> for whatever criticisms any one might make about philip's indolence and disinclination to study <space> no one could deny that he had very good manners <space>
<space> yet <space> when he had an appreciative audience <space> and girls generally appreciated <space> what philip said <space> he would often spend as much as half an hour talking about the fellows <space>
<space> he only looked a little sheepish <space> the other fellows said <space>
<space> though only about four years their senior <space> he seemed much older than brenda and her friends <space> years before they had all been playmates together <space> but his two years in college had taken him away from them <space>
<space> there are a lot of girls studying in cambridge now at the annex <space> and the fellows don't like it at all <space> well i <space> declare <space> exclaimed nora <space> i'd like to know what difference it makes to them <space>
<space> well i wish myself that our english instructor hadn't such a fondness for reading themes to us that the girls have written <space> he makes out that they are better than ours <space> but i can't say that i see it myself <space> who gets the best marks <space>
<space> oh say did you hear about the time will hardon had with the dicky last week <space> he asked <space> nora nodded <space> she too had a brother in college <space> what was it <space> asked edith <space> you haven't told me philip <space>
<space> and he would grow almost enthusiastic when describing the tussle between ned brown <space> and stanley hooper over the respective merits of boston and new york <space> in which hooper the new yorker <space> was terribly beaten <space> and upon my word he concluded <space>
<space> interrupted philip <space> i've heard that some professors say that their annex classes do better work than ours <space> but anybody can tell <space> that that's all rot <space> i believe it's all perfectly true <space> said nora <space>
<space> philip looked over his shoulder in the glass <space> there was nothing the matter with his own shapely nose <space> and i doubt that he would have run any such risk as edith suggested <space> perhaps this was the reason why philip was not a fighter <space>
<space> ruth roberts is as pleasant a girl as there is in school <space> and yet she would have a terribly lonely time <space> if it were not for edith and julia <space> nobody else ever thinks of speaking to her <space> well why should we <space>
<space> the latter expressed her thanks in a glance towards her cousin <space> as ruth accepted very gracefully <space> and nora exclaimed <space> what fun we are going to have <space>
<space> for of course in the minds of the others there could be but one game <space>
<space> and those who had relatives in the team <space> were too proud for anything as brenda said <space> the game was to be played in holmes field <space> and tickets were not easy to get <space> because the seats were far less numerous than now on the great soldiers field <space>
<space> it's hard enough to have julia tagging about everywhere <space> but why in the world we should have ruth <space> roberts <space> when we never see her anywhere except at school <space> i really cannot understand <space> and i don't see how you and nora can like it <space> either <space> why <space>
<space> when the tongues of half a dozen girls <space> are vigorously discussing people and events <space> of which the listener has not the slightest knowledge <space> ruth herself was very independent <space>
<space> walking away from nora and brenda <space> i do not need to be told what to do <space> what nora or brenda might have answered i cannot say <space> for hardly had belle disappeared within the house <space> when edith herself appeared with julia and ruth <space>
<space> the girls were making up little groups to go to the game with youths of their acquaintance as escorts <space> under the chaperonage of older people <space> a few who had received no invitation <space> were especially miserable <space> and took no trouble to disguise their feelings <space>
<space> why <space> who is it cried brenda <space> and <space> who is it <space> echoed belle <space> i know that you can't guess <space> oh <space> don't be silly nora <space> it wouldn't be worth while to guess about something you'll know all about so soon <space>
<space> but i don't see <space> turning rather snappishly towards <space> brenda <space> why the rest of us have got to take up ruth roberts just because your cousin julia is so devoted to her <space> now this was a little too much <space> even for brenda <space>
<space> why it's a duty to do everything you can to help your own side <space> i never said that harvard was my side interrupted <space> belle <space> didn't i tell you that i have a cousin on the princeton team <space> you'd better not say anything of that <space> kind to philip <space>
<space> or to edith either <space> they are both perfectly devoted to harvard <space> and they expect their party to give great encouragement to the harvard team <space> why belle i cannot imagine your doing anything else <space> i'm not a child <space> responded belle very crossly <space>
<space> except that you speak as if it were some one we might not care to have <space> and if that's the case <space> i declare it's too bad <space> said belle <space> if it's anything like that <space> broke in brenda rather snappishly <space> i will just tell <space> edith what i think <space>
<space> ruth was a pretty and amiable girl <space> about julia's age <space> and therefore <space> a little older than the four <space> she had been in the school for two years before the coming of julia <space> but in all that time she had had only a speaking acquaintance with the other girls <space>
<space> was so annoyed by belle's proposed championship of princeton <space> that she was unexpectedly cordial to ruth <space> and almost to her own surprise <space> found herself <space> urging ruth to come to town early on the saturday of the game <space> to take luncheon with her and julia <space>
<space> and anyway <space> i'm thankful to have julia take a fancy to anybody <space> it leaves us a great deal freer to do as we like <space> i should think that you would see that yourself <space> oh well <space> said nora <space> laughing <space> the whole thing is not worth quarreling about <space>
<space> oh dear i can hardly wait for saturday <space> i know it <space> replied brenda <space> it's less than a week too <space> but it seems an awfully long time <space>
<space> she had acquired the habit of studying during recess <space> since after school she spent more time than most girls of her age in outdoor sports <space> it did her no great harm to pass the half hour of recess in this way <space> ruth as well as julia <space>
<space> for a week before thanksgiving <space> there was great excitement among the schoolgirls on account of the approaching football game <space> the four were as excited as the others <space> although not so many of their own particular friends were in the harvard team <space>
<space> and even occasionally from brenda <space> both of whom were inclined to be more exclusive <space> so it happened that the general harmony of the four <space> was somewhat disturbed when nora one day at recess exclaimed <space> who do you suppose is going with us to the game <space>
<space> yes <space> that's what i think too <space> nora smiled pleasantly <space> and her eyes looked brighter than ever under the rim of her brown felt hat <space> with its trimmings of lighter brown <space> nora's temper was not <space> easily ruffled <space>
<space> then belle added a final word <space> oh <space> it's clear that this is all julia's doings <space>
<space> and would perhaps <space> have been a little <space> uncomfortable in joining them <space> no one gets a great deal of enjoyment <space> from reading a single chapter in the middle of a book <space> and so it is often hard to be a mere listener <space>
<space> you need not look so surprised rejoined nora <space> and if you take my advice <space> you will not say anything to edith <space> she ought to have her own way in arranging her own party <space> and you know when she makes up her mind it is of no use to talk to her about it <space>
<space> yes i know <space> but still <space> the least said <space> the soonest mended <space> said nora <space> though to tell you the truth the quotation did not sound especially appropriate <space> the least said <space> the soonest mended <space>
<space> no one who saw the hearty way in which nora and brenda greeted <space> ruth <space> as she came up with edith and julia <space> could for a moment have imagined <space> that she had been under discussion <space> the mercurial brenda <space> for the moment <space>
<space> who had not been invited elsewhere to go in some other party <space> now edith <space> was of a generally generous disposition <space> and not inclined to limit her favors of whatever nature <space> to any particular set of girls <space>
<space> i am going to carry an orange scarf and perhaps an orange flag <space> what for <space> why <space> i never heard of such a thing <space> exclaimed nora <space> nor i <space> cried brenda <space> at a harvard game <space>
<space> ruth lived in the suburbs and as belle had said <space> outside of school the other girls seldom saw her <space> at recess <space> each little group <space> had so many personal things to talk about <space> that an outsider would have been decidedly in the way <space>
<space> i should call it very impolite if there were no orange flags shown at the game <space> well you have the most ridiculous ideas <space> hasn't she brenda <space> brenda nodded assent <space> and nora continued <space>
<space> it <space> that <space> cried nora <space> didn't i say that it was a person <space> a girl if i must be more definite <space> ruth roberts if i must tell just who it is <space> oh <space> cried belle <space> and <space> ah <space> echoed brenda <space>
<space> that they were very selfish in leaving their schoolmate so entirely to herself <space> it was not because they did not like her <space> they were merely so very much wrapped up in their own affairs <space> that they hardly noticed that she was often left to herself <space>
<space> it was to be a game with princeton <space> one of the great university matches <space> and for special reasons there was the deepest interest in the match <space> those girls who had brothers in college <space> or even cousins or friends <space> held themselves with more dignity than any of the others <space>
<space> had undertaken to prepare for college <space> and it had been a great delight to her to have the latter placed with her in one or two special classes <space> julia's liking for her had made edith take a little more interest in her <space> than would otherwise have been the case <space>
<space> piped <space> missus oriole timidly <space> the orioles always have built in this manner <space> and it suits our constitution <space> a fiddle on your constitution <space> how can you tell what agrees with your constitution <space> unless you try <space> you own you are not well <space>
<space> no no my good friend i never make mistakes <space> what i know <space> i know certainly <space>
<space> and nancy nibble <space> who are married this very day <space> i knew that thing six weeks before any bird or beast in our parts <space> and i can tell you <space> you are going to be scandalously and ungratefully treated doctor bullfrog <space>
<space> latterly some youngsters <space> had arisen who sneered at his performances as behind the age <space> in fact <space> since a great city had grown up <space> in the vicinity of the forest <space> tribes of wandering boys broke up the simple tastes and quiet habits <space>
<space> but then he had a weakness for concerts and general society because he was held to be by all odds the handsomest bird in the woods <space> and sung like an angel <space> and so the truth was <space> he didn't confine himself so much to the domestic nest <space> as tom titmouse <space> or billy wren <space>
<space> i say my dear <space> if you will persist in gossiping over our private family matters with that old mother magpie <space> my dear i don't gossip <space> she comes and bores me to death with talking and then goes off and mistakes what she has been saying for what i said <space>
<space> then having perfectly bewildered the poor old gentleman <space> who was always sleepy of a monday morning <space> mother magpie would take a peep into missus oriole's nest <space> sit chattering on a bough above <space> and pour forth floods of advice <space>
<space> o missus magpie pray don't speak to my husband <space> he will think i've been complaining <space> no no he won't <space> let me alone <space> i understand just how to say the thing <space> i've advised hundreds of young husbands in my day and i never gave offence <space>
<space> bless me we shall all be ruined said missus bullfrog <space> my poor husband <space> oh as to that <space> if you take things in time <space> and listen to my advice <space> said mother magpie <space> we may yet pull you through <space> you must alter your style a little <space>
<space> madam <space> said doctor bullfrog with all that energy of tone for which he was remarkable <space> i don't believe it <space> i can't <space> believe it <space> you must have made a mistake <space>
<space> got himself <space> universally laughed at for aping fashionable manners <space> every bird and beast in the forest had a gibe at him <space> and even old parson too whit <space> thought it worth his while to make him a pastoral call <space>
<space> we are the true musical race <space> and so poor mister bullfrog was persuaded to forego his pleasant little cottage under the cat tails <space> where his green spectacles and honest round back <space> had excited <space> even in the minds of the boys <space> sentiments of respect and compassion <space>
<space> but you must <space> cut her <space> i try to <space> all i can but she won't <space> be cut <space> it's enough to make a bird swear <space> said tommy oriole <space> tommy oriole to say the truth <space> had as good a heart as ever beat under bird's feathers <space>
<space> dear madam consider my voice <space> i never could hit the high notes <space> how do you know <space> it's all practice <space> tommy oriole says so <space> just try the scales <space> as to your voice <space> your manner of living has a great deal to do with it <space>
<space> which old mother nature had always kept up in those parts <space> they pulled the young checkerberry before it even had time to blossom <space> rooted up the sassafras shrubs and gnawed their roots <space> fired off guns at the birds <space> and on several occasions <space>
<space> but my husband prefers this style of building <space> that's only because he isn't properly instructed <space> pray did you ever attend doctor kite's lectures on the nervous system <space> no i have no time to attend lectures <space> who would sit on the eggs <space>
<space> i always did tell you that your passion for water injured your singing <space> suppose tommy oriole should sit half his days up to his hips in water as you do <space> his voice would be as hoarse and rough as yours <space> come up on the bank and learn to perch as we birds do <space>
<space> and sometimes will take the most unreasonable courses <space> if a meddlesome magpie gets her claw into their nest <space> but old mother magpie had now got a new business in hand in another quarter <space> she bustled off down to water dock lane where <space> as we said in a former narrative <space>
<space> adapt it to modern times <space> everybody now is a little touched with the operatic fever <space> and there's tommy oriole has been to new orleans <space> and brought back a touch of the artistic <space> if you would try his style a little <space> something tyrolean you see <space>
<space> lived the old music teacher <space> doctor bullfrog <space> the poor old doctor was a simple minded good <space> amiable creature <space> who had played the double bass <space> and led the forest choir on all public occasions since nobody knows when <space>
<space> you are subject to headaches <space> and every physician will tell you <space> that a tilting motion disorders the stomach and acts upon the brain <space> ask old doctor kite <space> i was talking with him about your case only yesterday <space> and says he <space> missus magpie i perfectly agree with you <space>
<space> when old doctor bullfrog was leading a concert <space> had dashed in and broken up the choir by throwing stones <space> this was not the worst of it <space> the little varlets had a way of jeering at the simple old doctor and his concerts <space>
<space> and this was the case with mother magpie <space> she was always full of everybody's business but her own <space> up and down here and there everywhere but in her own nest <space> knowing everyone's affairs <space> telling what everybody had been doing <space> or ought to do <space>
<space> he came up into the garden <space> and established himself under a burdock <space> and began to practise italian scales <space> the result was that poor old doctor bullfrog <space> instead of being considered as a respectable old bore <space>
<space> that old bullfrog was a bore <space> and that it was time to get up a new style of music in the parish <space> and to give the charge of it to some more modern performer <space>
<space> and admonish him about courses <space> unbefitting his age and standing <space> as to mother magpie <space> you may be sure that she assured every one how sorry she was that dear old doctor bullfrog <space> had made such a fool of himself <space>
<space> my wife was all well enough content <space> till old mother magpie interfered <space> it is quite my duty to take strong ground and show that i cannot be dictated to <space>
<space> poor old doctor bullfrog knew nothing of this however and was doing his simple best in peace <space> when mother magpie called in upon him one morning <space> well neighbour how unreasonable people are <space> who would have thought <space>
<space> now you complain always that your head aches whenever i call upon you <space> it's all on account of this way of swinging and swaying about in such an absurd manner <space> but <space> my dear <space>
<space> the fact is quoth tommy <space> i am a society bird <space> and nature has marked out for me a course beyond the range of the commonplace <space> and my wife must learn to accommodate <space> if she has a brilliant husband <space>
whose success gratifies her ambition and places her in a distinguished public position <space> she must pay something for it <space> i'm sure billy wren's wife would give her very bill to see her husband in the circles where i am quite at home <space> to say the truth <space>
<space> but the tragedy for the poor old music teacher grew even more melancholy in its termination <space> for one day as he was sitting disconsolately <space> under a currant bush <space> in the garden <space> practising his poor old notes in a quiet way <space> thump <space>
<space> and ready to cast her advice gratis <space> at every bird and beast of the woods <space> now she bustled up to the parsonage at the top of the oak tree <space> to tell old parson too whit <space> what she thought he ought to preach <space> for his next sermon <space> and how dreadful the morals of the parish were becoming <space>
<space> depend upon it my dear <space> mother magpie would say <space> that this way of building your nest <space> swinging like an old empty stocking from a bough <space> isn't at all the thing <space> i never built one so in my life <space> and i never have headaches <space>
<space> that with the aid of a brown wig <space> after he had cut off his hair he was completely disguised <space> he soon notified his brother who lived in another part of the city <space> and both put themselves out of harm's way <space>
<space> these agents <space> were entertained by abolitionists in the city <space> and many of us <space> had two or three of them in each of our families for a couple of weeks <space>
<space> instead stands up in all our southern states the freedman <space> knowing his rights <space> and as a rule enjoying them <space> original american abolitionists <space> who met the scorn and odium <space> the imputed shame and obloquy <space>
<space> but hearing that there were a few loaded muskets there <space> they took it out in threats <space> but their mercantile establishment <space> was almost ostracised at this time by the dry goods merchants <space>
<space> and are now both in the city <space> i am a blacksmith and have worked six months <space> in one shop in new york with white journeymen <space> not one of whom believes i suppose that i am a colored man <space> it was not surprising for so fair was his complexion <space>
<space> and with a few others devoted the most of the sabbath to their teaching <space> when he and his brother arthur <space> assembled the seventy anti slavery agents <space> who were thereafter like firebrands <space> scattered all over the land <space> they held their meetings in this room <space>
<space> those who had money contributed it freely <space> and those who were destitute of money <space> gave their time <space> saying with the apostle <space> silver and gold have i none <space> but such as i have <space> give i thee <space> one <space>
<space> they were remarkably fine young men and it seemed a special providence that i should find them in such a large city <space> and direct them to escape from their pursuer <space> within one hour after i left my house in brooklyn <space>
<space> on being put upon the auction block this young man addressed the bystanders <space> and told them the circumstances of the case <space> that his mother had long lived in the family of the doctor <space> that it was cruel to sell her and her children <space>
<space> my father said i <space> has long been one of your first doctors <space> and do you think it right for him to sell my mother and his children in this way <space> i was sold and my brother also <space> and the rest although my brother said to the crowd what i had said <space> we soon made our escape <space>
<space> and he warned the people not to bid for him <space> for he would no longer be a slave to any man <space> and if any one bought him <space> he would lose his money <space> he added <space> i thought it right to say this <space> i then spoke to the crowd <space>
<space> mister tappan was therefore requested to furnish a few reminiscences <space> from his own store house <space> which he kindly did as follows <space>
<space> how were you treated by your master and mistress <space> they treated me very well <space> how then said i could you put yourself in the care of that sailor <space> who was a stranger to you and leave your parents <space> i shall never forget her heart felt reply <space>
<space> a missus mercy smith <space> beckoned <space> to me to come to her class <space>
<space> and especially in the vigilance committee for many years <space> from serious affection of his eyes <space>
<space> on the occasion of the return of the amistad captors <space> to their native land <space> and now doing so much for the freedmen <space> of the south <space> was almost entirely established by his efforts <space> during the continuance of slavery much was done by this society <space>
<space> and who had escaped and were supposed to be <space> in new york <space> the letter requested me to find them and give them warning <space> as there was no time to be lost <space> i concluded to go over to new york <space> notwithstanding the doubtfulness <space> of attempting to find them in so large a city <space>
<space> which may afford you and your readers some gratification <space> these facts i must give without reference to date as i will not tax my memory with perhaps a vain attempt to narrate them in order <space> as mentioned in my <space> life of arthur tappan <space>
<space> the vigilance committee for aiding and befriending fugitives of which i was treasurer <space> for many years <space> had no better or warmer friend than he <space> he was almost always at their meetings <space> which were known only <space> to the elect <space> for we dared not hold them too publicly <space>
<space> i wrote notices to be read in the colored churches <space> and colored sabbath schools which i delivered in person <space> i then went to the colored school <space> superintended <space>
<space> to my inquiry <space> have you parents living and also brothers and sisters <space> she replied <space> there is no child but myself <space> were not your parents kind to you and did you not love them <space> yes i love them very much <space>
<space> many remittances came <space> for the help of the vigilance committee <space> from england and scotland <space> and at one time an extensive invoice of useful and fancy articles in several large boxes <space> was received from the glasgow ladies <space> sufficient to furnish a large bazaar or fair <space>
<space> in answer to my inquiries <space> this girl told me the name of the southern city <space> and the names of the persons who had held her as a slave <space> and the mode of her escape <space> et cetera <space> i was walking near the water she said <space> when a white sailor spoke to me <space>
<space> i recollect that one morning on reaching my office <space> that of the treasurer of the american missionary association <space> my assistant told me that in the inner room were eighteen fugitives <space> men women and children who had arrived that morning from the south <space> in one company <space>
<space> to write such an article <space> as would be worthy of your publication <space> however feeling somewhat relieved to day <space> from my paralysis owing to the cheering sunshine and the favor of my almighty preserver <space> i will try to do what i can in dictating a few anecdotes <space> to my amanuensis <space>
<space> and by different agencies to canada <space> two <space>
<space> among which <space> were the anti slavery record <space> the emancipator <space> the slave's friend <space> the latter to indoctrinate the children in anti slavery <space> the american missionary society originally begun for the support of a mission in africa <space>
<space> he told me i should be free <space> one sunday morning i received a letter informing me <space> that an officer belonging to savannah ga <space> had started for new york <space> in pursuit of two young men <space> of nineteen or twenty <space>
<space> of savannah <space> and that he had five children by the young man's mother <space> who was his slave <space> on his marriage to a white woman <space> he sent his five colored children and their mother to auction <space> to be sold for cash to the highest bidder <space>
<space> if i would come to him in the evening <space> i did so and was hid and fed by him <space> and on landing at new york <space> he conducted me to missus smith's house <space> where i am now staying <space>
<space> and when they did so <space> requested particularly <space> that the bundles or boxes should not be marked <space> from <space> a tappan and co <space> as was customary <space> southern merchants especially <space> avoided them <space>
<space> i stated my errand to him <space> with a description of the young men <space> why <space> said he <space> i must have one of them in my school <space> he took me to a class where i found one of the young men <space> to whom i gave the needful information <space>
<space> as we almost always had some of the travelers toward the north star present <space> whose masters <space> or their agents were frequently in the city <space> in hot pursuit <space> at first we sent them to canada <space> but after a while <space> sent them <space> only to syracuse <space> and the centre of the state <space>
<space> but reflection convinced them that it was not only right to assist men in efforts to obtain their liberty <space> when unjustly held in bondage <space> but a duty <space> abolitionists <space> white and colored both in slave and free states <space>
<space> which was held in brooklyn for the benefit <space> of the committee <space> although lately afflicted by disease <space> mister tappan still lives in the enjoyment <space> of all his faculties <space> and a good measure of health <space>
<space> most of the teachers were warm hearted abolitionists <space> and the whole number taught in this school during this period <space> was seven or eight hundred <space>
<space> in eighteen thirty four i think was the first rioting <space> the sacking of mister tappan's house <space> in rose street <space> the mob brought all his furniture out <space> and piling it up in the street <space> set it on fire <space> the family were absent at the time <space>
<space> they went out all over the land and were instrumental <space> in diffusing more truth perhaps about the dreadful system of american slavery <space> than was accomplished in any other way <space> he also aided in establishing several periodicals <space> brimful of anti slavery truth <space>
<space> my dear sir <space> in answer to your request that i would furnish an article for your forthcoming book <space> giving incidents within my personal knowledge <space> relating to the underground rail road <space> i have already apprized you of my illness <space> and my consequent inability <space>
<space> ye have done it <space> unto me <space> anthony lane <space> new york <space> november eighth <space> eighteen seventy one <space> mister lane mister tappan's personal friend who labored with him <space> in the anti slavery cause <space>
<space> and when two or three years later <space> there was a general insolvency among them <space> occasionally large losses to new york merchants <space> and in some cases failure <space> the tappans <space> were saved by having no southern debts <space>
<space> whom they had hired to conduct them <space> without the limits <space> of the city in the evening <space> when the police force was changed <space> they came through pennsylvania and new jersey to my office <space>
<space> and in his advanced years <space> sees now some of the great results <space> of his life long efforts for the restoration and maintenance of human rights <space> although still suffering under many of the evils which slavery has inflicted upon him <space> the american slave no longer exists <space>
<space> and then sat down until it should stop <space> aching <space> wait for me <space> he called out to his brothers and sisters <space> i'm coming in a minute <space> the other little turtles waited <space> but when his toe was comfortable again <space> and he started toward them <space> he met a very interesting snail <space>
<space> he was thinking over and over <space> something has happened something has happened <space> and he knew that back in the pond his mother would be trying to find him and could not <space> the boys carried him to the edge of the meadow and put him down on the grass <space>
<space> and can move quickly if they will <space> this is why other turtles sometimes make fun of a slow brother <space> by calling him a land tortoise <space> one beautiful sunshiny afternoon <space> when most of the twenty little turtles were sitting on a floating log by the edge of the pond <space>
<space> and talked a while with him <space> come on said the biggest little turtle <space> don't let's wait any longer he can catch up <space> so they sprawled along until they came to a place <space> where they could sit in a row <space> on an old log <space> and they climbed onto it <space> and sat just close enough together <space>
<space> does my shell look very bad he cried <space> i wish i could see it <space> oh i am so glad to get back <space> i'll never be slow again never never <space> his mother came and leaned her shell lovingly against his <space>
<space> the mother turtle raised one of her forefeet until all five of its toes with their strong claws were pointing at him <space> she also raised her head as far as her upper shell would let her <space> so you are the one she said <space>
<space> and the nine brothers and sisters on his left side <space> looking at him <space> out of their right eyes <space> he drew in his head and his tail and his legs <space> until all they could see was his rounded upper shell <space> his shell side walls <space> and the yellow edge of his flat lower shell <space>
<space> you certainly are for i saw you scrambling out of the sand <space> a little while ago <space> and you came from the very place where i laid my eggs <space> and covered them during the first really warm nights this year <space> i was telling your father only yesterday <space> that it was about time for you to hatch <space>
<space> and not at all too close <space> then the slow little turtle came hurrying over the sand <space> with a rather cross look in his eyes <space> and putting his feet down a little harder than he needed to <space> quite as though he were out of patience about something <space> why didn't you turtles wait for me <space>
<space> i did hope said the mother turtle that i might have one family without such a child in it <space> i cannot help loving even a slow child who is cross <space> if he is hatched from one of my eggs <space> yet it makes me sad <space> very very sad <space>
<space> and you she added turning to his brothers and sisters <space> must be patient with him <space> we shall not have him with us long <space>
<space> and again he fell fast asleep <space>
<space> then one of these great animals stooped over and picked him up <space> and held him bottom side uppermost <space> and rapped on that side <space> which was flat <space> and on the other side which was rounded <space> and stared at him <space> with two great eyes <space>
<space> he is the quickest one in his family <space> the pond people looked at each other and laughed <space> that is queer they said <space> after this we will call him the quick little turtle <space> this made him very happy <space> and when once in a while somebody forgot <space>
<space> yet down in his little turtle heart he thought <space> now they are going to catch it <space> he was sure his mother was going to scold the other turtle children for leaving him <space> he wanted to see what they would do <space> so he looked out of his right eye at the ten brothers and sisters on that side <space>
<space> then he was very very tired <space> but he wanted so much to get back to his home in the pond <space> that he started at once by moonlight <space> this was the first time he had ever seen the moon <space> for except <space> when they are laying eggs <space> turtles usually sleep at night <space>
<space> she could see their strong little pointed tails too <space> and their webbed feet <space> with a stout claw on each toe <space> she was so proud that she could not help talking about them <space>
who lags behind and wants the others to wait for him <space> that makes him miss his share of good things <space> and then he is quite certain to be cross and think it is somebody else's fault <space> the slow little turtle felt the ten brothers and sisters on his right side <space> looking at him out of their left eyes <space>
<space> i remember so well my first slow child <space> and how he <space> she began to cry <space> and since she could not easily get her forefeet to her eyes <space> she sprawled to the pond and swam off with only her head <space> and a little of her upper shell showing above the water <space>
<space> and these cousins of the turtles look so much like them <space> that some people cannot tell them apart <space> that is because they forget that the tortoises live on land <space> have higher back shells <space> and move very very slowly <space> turtles live more in the water <space>
<space> why are you not up here with your brothers and sisters <space> she asked suddenly of the slow little turtle <space> who was trying to make a place for himself on the log <space> they didn't wait for me he said <space> i was coming right along but they wouldn't wait <space> i think they are just as mea <space>
<space> i wish i might help you some time <space>
<space> yes <space> said a fine old fellow who was floating near her <space> a row of their mothers <space> he was a turtle whom she had never liked very well <space> but now she began to think that he was rather agreeable after all <space>
<space> the slow little mud turtle <space> when the twenty little mud turtles broke their egg shells one hot summer day <space> and poked their way up through the warm sand in which they had been buried <space> they looked almost as much alike as so many raindrops <space>
<space> if you will only learn to keep up with your brothers and sisters she said <space> i shall not be sorry that the boys carried you off <space> you just wait and see said the slow little turtle <space> and he was as good as his word <space> after that <space>
<space> or because he wanted to do this or <space> look at that or talk to some other person <space> he was a very trying little turtle yet his mother loved him <space> and did not like it when the rest called him a land tortoise <space> it is all right you know to be a land tortoise when your father and mother are land tortoises <space>
<space> next <space> the other great animal took him and turned him over <space> and rapped on his shells and stared at him <space>
<space> i'm here <space> he cried joyfully <space> poking first one and then another of them with his head <space> the biggest little turtle moved without awakening <space> i tell you i'm not hungry <space> he murmured <space>
<space> the mother turtle who was sunning herself on the bank near by <space> said to her friends <space> why <space> there are my children <space> did you ever see a finer family <space> i believe i will go over and speak to them <space>
<space> the sun has been so hot lately that i was sure you would do well <space> the mother turtle stretched her head this way and that <space> until there was hardly a wrinkle left in her neck skin <space> she was so eager to see them all <space>
<space> but cuddled inside his two shells and went to sleep also <space> he was so tired that he did not awaken until the sun was high in the sky <space> when he did open his eyes <space> his relatives were sitting around looking at him <space> and he remembered all that had happened before he slept <space>
<space> this did not really give him pain <space> yet as he said afterward <space> it hurts almost as much to think you are going to be hurt <space> as it does to be hurt <space> it was not until the sun went down that the boys let the slow little turtle go <space>
<space> and slid into the water <space> all her friends following her <space> the biggest little turtle <space> saw these great animals coming toward him <space> he sprawled off the end of his log and slid into the water <space> and all his brothers and sisters followed him <space> except the slow little turtle <space>
<space> i thought you were when i heard you trying to make the others wait <space> it is too bad <space>
<space> and by mistake called him <space> the quick slow little turtle <space>
<space> the first year i had only a few children <space> the next year i had more <space> and so it has gone <space> every year a few more children than the year before <space> until now i never know quite how many i do have <space> but there is always one slow little turtle <space>
<space> he lay perfectly still for a long long time <space> and when he thought they had forgotten about him <space> he tried to run away <space> then they laughed and picked him up again <space> and one of them took something sharp and shiny and cut marks into his upper shell <space>
<space> their mother was with some of her friends on another log near by <space> she looked often at her children <space> and thought how handsome their rounded up back shells were in the sunshine <space> with the little red and yellow markings <space> showing on the black <space>
<space> the slow little turtle was really frightened by what his mother had said <space> and for a few days he tried to keep up with the others <space> nothing happened to him and so he grew careless and made people wait for him just because he was not quite ready to go with them <space>
<space> he was always the first to slip from the log to the water if <space> anything scared them <space> and when one day <space> a strange turtle from another pond came to visit <space> he said to the turtles who had always lived there <space>
<space> she was just noticing how beautifully the skin wrinkled on his neck <space> when she heard a splash <space> and saw two terrible great two legged animals wading into the pond from the shore <space> boys <space> she cried <space> boys <space> and she sprawled off the end of her log <space>
<space> she pursued <space> bending her eyes <space> determinately upon him <space> it must be <space> with all my heart <space> returned sir francis <space> it is you who have thrown out the challenge mind <space>
<space> settling the logs to his apparent satisfaction <space> to speak and act <space> let there be plain truth between us at this interview <space> if there never has been before <space> i don't understand you <space> naked truth <space> unglossed over <space>
<space> i do not understand what you would imply <space> she said <space> drawing her shawl round her with a fresh shiver <space> how on the wrong scent <space> with regard to your husband and that hare girl <space> you were blindly outrageously jealous of him <space> go on <space>
which was at the far end of the great barn of a room <space> and taking the writing case from it gave it to her <space> she reached her keys from the stand at her elbow <space> unlocked the case <space> and took from it some bank notes <space>
<space> well isabel you must be aware <space> that it is an awful sacrifice for a man in my position <space> to marry a divorced woman <space> the hectic flushed into her thin cheeks <space> but her voice sounded <space> calm as before <space>
<space> and carlyle was acting in it under the rose <space> for missus hare <space> she could not seek out carlyle herself <space> so she sent the young lady <space> that's all i know <space> how did you know it <space> i had reason to think so <space>
<space> whose fits of ill temper were under no control <space> and who never <space> when in them <space> cared what he said to outrage the feelings of another <space> the temptation to sin as you call it <space> lay not in my persuasions half so much <space> as in your jealous anger toward your husband <space>
<space> than i found myself <space> overwhelmed with <space> business <space> and away from it i could not get <space> even now i can only remain with you a couple of days <space> for i must hasten back to town <space> you are breaking faith already <space> she said <space> after hearing him calmly to the end <space>
what reason <space> i must request you to tell me <space> i overheard scraps of their conversation now and then in those meetings <space> and so gathered my information <space> you told a different tale to me sir francis <space> was her remark <space>
<space> was her icy answer <space> let's see how old is he now <space> he was born on the last day of august <space> sir francis threw up his arms and stretched himself <space> as if a fit of idleness had overtaken him <space> then advanced to the cradle and pulled down the clothes <space>
<space> your words are not words of truth but of deceit <space> you did not intend to be back in time for the marriage <space>
<space> if you have taken this aversion to me it <space> cannot be helped <space> he coldly said <space> inwardly congratulating himself <space> let us not doubt <space> at being spared the work of trouble he had anticipated <space> you made commotion enough once about me making you reparation <space>
<space> resumed sir francis <space> in a little time you may probably wish to recall it <space> in which case a line <space> addressed to me at my banker's will <space> lady isabel drew herself up <space> put away those notes if you please <space> she interrupted not allowing him to finish his sentence <space>
<space> and bring a clergyman into the room to perform the ceremony <space> it would be futile <space> the injury to the child can never be repaired <space> and for myself <space> i cannot imagine any fate in life <space> worse than being compelled to pass it with you <space>
<space> over his shoulder in the direction of the cradle <space> what have you named that young article there <space> the name which ought to have been his by inheritance <space>
<space> then he paid a visit to the landlord <space> and handed him <space> likewise a year's rent in advance <space> making the same remark <space> after that he ordered dinner at a hotel <space> and the same night <space> he and pierre <space> departed on their journey home again <space>
<space> alas <space> it was the actual crying of her own child which awoke her <space> this last child <space> the ill fated little being in the cradle beside her <space>
<space> sarcastically rejoined sir francis <space> generous man <space> a flush deep and painful dyed her cheeks <space> i should have said my late husband <space> you need not have reminded me of the mistake <space>
<space> i saw by the date <space> that it was one of those two which you received on the morning of your departure <space> it contained the information that the divorce was pronounced <space> she spoke so quietly <space> so apparently without feeling or passion <space> that sir francis was agreeably astonished <space>
<space> and to make you my wife would so offend all my family that <space> stay <space> interrupted lady <space> isabel <space> you need not trouble yourself to find needless excuses <space> had you taken this journey for the purpose of making me your wife <space> were you to propose to do so this day <space>
<space> but that she seemed never to have gone away from it <space> walking in the flower garden with mister carlyle <space> while the three children played on the lawn <space> her arm was within her husband's <space> and he was relating something to her <space> what the news was <space> she could not remember afterward <space>
<space> it would have been better to have undeceived me then <space> to have told me that the hopes i was cherishing <space> for the sake of the unborn child were worse than vain <space> i did not judge so <space> he replied <space> the excited state you then appeared to be in <space>
<space> who is he like isabel <space> my handsome self <space> were he like you in spirit <space> i would pray that he might die ere he could speak or think <space> she burst forth <space> and then remembering the resolution marked out for herself <space> subsided <space>
<space> she made no reply <space> sir francis put the clothes back over the sleeping child <space> returned to the fire <space> and stood a few moments with his back to it <space> is my room prepared for me do you know <space> he presently asked <space> no it is not <space> she quietly rejoined <space>
<space> sir francis thanking his lucky star <space> that he had so easily got rid of a vexatious annoyance <space> and lady isabel <space> she passed her evening alone <space> sitting in the same place <space> close to the fire and the sparks <space>
<space> outwardly into calmness again <space> what else <space> retorted sir francis <space> you know my disposition pretty well by this time isabel <space> and may be sure that if you deal out small change to me <space>
<space> and the calmer he spoke <space> the more cutting were his words <space> he need not have told her this <space> what was the secret <space> she inquired in a low tone <space> nay i can't explain all <space> they did not take me into their confidence <space> they did not even take you <space>
<space> if you will accept nothing for yourself you must for the child <space> he at any rate falls to my share <space> i shall give you a few hundred a year with him <space> she beat her hands before her <space> as if beating off the man and his words <space>
<space> she shook her head <space> all the reparation in your power to make <space> all the reparation that the whole world can invent <space> could not undo my sin <space> it <space> and the effects <space> must lie upon me forever <space> oh sin <space> was the derisive exclamation <space>
<space> remember though that it is your doing not mine <space> but you cannot think i am going to see you starve isabel <space> a sum <space> we will fix upon the amount amicably <space>
<space> these apartments are mine now <space> they have been transferred into my name and they can never again afford you accommodation <space> will you be so obliging <space> i am not strong <space> as to hand me that writing case <space> sir francis walked to the table she indicated <space>
<space> into an adjoining room <space> when lady isabel lay down to rest <space> she sank into a somewhat <space> calmer sleep <space> than she had known of late <space> also into a dream <space> she thought she was back at east lynne <space> not back in one sense <space>
<space> what fancies you do take up <space> uttered <space> francis levison <space> some time subsequent to your departure <space> she quietly went on <space> one of the maids was setting to rights the clothes in your dressing closet <space> and she brought me a letter she found in one of the pockets <space>
<space> he took out his pocket book <space> and placed the bank notes within it <space> your clothes <space>
<space> i beg of you to cease <space> she passionately interrupted <space> what do you take me for <space> take you for <space> why how can you live you have no fortune <space> you must receive assistance from some one <space> i will not receive it from you <space> if the whole world denied me <space>
<space> quite true <space> was her reply <space> and i believe you were on the wrong scent isabel <space> if it will be any satisfaction to you to hear it <space> since we are mutually on this complimentary discourse <space> it is of no consequence to smooth over facts <space>
<space> when you left in july you gave me a sacred promise to come back in time for our marriage <space> you know what i mean when i say in time but <space> of <space> course i meant to do so when i gave the promise <space> he interrupted <space> but no sooner had i set my foot in london <space>
<space> he should have less trouble in throwing off the mask <space> but he was an ill tempered man <space> and to hear that the letter had been found <space> to have the falseness of his <space> fine protestations and promises laid bare <space> did not improve his temper now <space> lady isabel continued <space>
<space> allow me to return them to you <space> count <space> them <space> return them to me for what <space> inquired sir francis in amazement <space> i <space> have no longer anything whatever to do with you in any way <space> do not make my arm ache holding out these notes to you so long <space> take them <space>
<space> if it be your wish that all relations should end between us why let it be so he said <space> i must confess i think it may be the wisest course <space> as things have come to this pass <space> for a cat and dog life <space> which would seemingly be ours is not agreeable <space>
<space> and i say i think you are on the wrong scent <space> i do not believe mister carlyle ever thought of the girl <space> in that way <space> what do you mean <space> she gasped <space> they had a secret between them <space> not of love <space> a secret of business <space> and those interviews they had together <space>
<space> whom do you take me for <space> what <space> do you take me for <space> she repeated rising in her bitter mortification <space> if you have put me beyond the pale of the world <space> i am still lord mount severn's daughter <space> you did as much toward putting yourself beyond its pale as <space>
<space> i wish you a good day <space> so you will not even shake hands with me isabel <space> i would prefer not <space> and thus they parted <space> sir francis left the room <space> but not immediately the house <space> he went into a distant apartment <space>
<space> and saw an infant's cradle by the side of the bed <space> he did not take the trouble to look at it <space> i am the representative now of an <space> ancient and respected baronetcy <space> he <space> resumed <space> in a tone as of apology for his previous heartless words <space>
<space> and calling the servants before him <space> there were but <space> two <space> gave them each a year's wages in advance <space>
<space> you will have the goodness to order pierre to take away this afternoon <space> and now sir francis <space> i believe that is all <space> we will part <space> to remain mortal enemies from henceforth <space> is that to be it <space> to be strangers <space> she replied correcting him <space>
<space> don't i know it <space> have i not said so <space> she sharply interrupted <space> and then she sat <space> striving to calm herself <space> clasping together her shaking hands <space> well if you will persist in this perverse resolution i cannot mend it <space>
<space> you ladies should think of that beforehand <space> yes she sadly answered <space> may heaven help all to do so <space> who may be tempted as i was <space> if you mean that as a reproach to me it's rather out of place <space> chafed sir francis <space>
<space> excepting that it was connected with the office and old mister dill <space> and that mister carlyle laughed when he told it <space> they appeared to be interrupted by the crying of archibald <space> and in turning to the lawn <space> to ask what was the matter <space> she awoke <space>
<space> when i expected or wished <space> for the sacrifice <space> it was not for my own sake <space> i told you so then <space> but it was not made <space> and the child's inheritance is that of sin and shame <space> there he lies <space> sir francis half turned to where she pointed <space>
<space> i received these from you a <space> month ago she said <space> they came by post <space> and never had the grace to acknowledge them <space> he returned in a sort of mock reproachful tone <space> forty pounds that was the amount was it not <space> i believe so <space>
<space> her dancing attendance upon him perpetually <space> related to that and that alone <space> her face was more flushed than it had been throughout the interview <space> he spoke quietly now <space> quite in an <space> equal tone of reasoning <space> it was his way when the ill temper was upon him <space>
<space> would have precluded your listening to any sort of reason <space> her heart beat a little quicker but she stilled it <space> you deem that it was not in reason <space> that i should aspire to be the wife of sir francis levison <space> he rose and began kicking at the logs <space> with the heel of his boot this time <space>
<space> as she turned her indignant eyes toward him <space> sir francis laughed <space> all stratagems are fair in love and war <space> she dared not immediately trust herself to reply <space> and a silence ensued <space> sir francis broke it pointing with his left thumb <space>
<space> how can you be so alarmed isabel of course i have <space> he continued <space> in a peevish though kind tone <space> as he took hold of her hands to raise her <space> no not yet <space> i will remain here until you say you will wait another day or two <space>
<space> she had had a long illness <space> terminating in a low fever <space>
<space> lady isabel waited till the man was gone and then spoke <space> a faint flush of emotion <space> in her cheeks <space> you do not mean what you say <space> you will not leave me yet <space> i cannot do otherwise he answered <space> there's a mountain of business to be attended to <space>
<space> you will wait <space> i cannot wait he replied <space> his tone changing to one of determination <space> it is useless to urge it <space> he broke from her and left the room <space> and in another minute had left the house <space> pierre attending him <space> a feeling amounting to a conviction <space>
<space> besides i should not choose for the old man's funeral to take place without me <space>
<space> at last <space> thank the <space> pigs <space> was the gentleman's euphonious expression <space> as he tossed the letter open on the breakfast table <space> the divorce is granted <space> feverishly uttered lady isabel <space> he made no reply but seated himself to breakfast <space>
<space> you will speedily gather his motive <space> pierre departed toward captain levison's room <space> and lady isabel took up the letters <space> and examined their superscription with interest <space> it was known to her that mister carlyle had not lost a moment <space>
<space> taking one absence with the other <space> he had been away from her <space> chiefly in paris <space> pursuing his own course and his own pleasure <space> how fared it with lady isabel <space> just as it must be expected to fare <space> and does fare <space>
<space> nearly a year went by <space> lady isabel carlyle had spent it on the continent <space> that refuge for such fugitives <space> now moving about from place to place with her companion <space> now stationary and alone <space> quite half the time <space>
<space> we beg to inform you that the suit <space> carlyle vs carlyle is at an end <space> the divorce was pronounced without opposition <space> according to your request <space> we hasten to forward you the earliest intimation of the fact <space> we are sir <space> faithfully yours <space> moss and grab <space>
<space> there has been no delay quite the contrary <space> but it may be expected hourly now <space> you are worrying yourself for nothing isabel i shall be back in time <space> he quitted the room as he spoke <space> and lady isabel remained in it <space> the image of despair <space>
<space> and she shook and shivered perpetually <space> though she had drawn so close to the wood fire <space> that there was a danger of her petticoats igniting <space> and the attendant had <space> frequently to spring up <space> and interpose between them <space> and the crackling logs <space>
<space> had he <space> come <space> who is it <space> she asked of the nurse <space> miladi it is monsieur <space> and <space> pierre is with him <space> i have <space> begged milady often and <space> often not to fret <space> for monsieur would surely come miladi <space> see <space> i am right <space>
<space> it was sharply wounding her with its adder stings <space> and she knew that her whole future existence <space> whether spent with that man or without him <space> would be a dark course of gnawing retribution <space> nearly a year went by <space> save some six or eight weeks <space>
<space> reputation <space> home <space> all that makes life of value to woman <space> she had forfeited her duty to god <space> had deliberately broken his commandments <space> for the <space> one poor miserable mistake <space> of flying <space> with francis levison <space>
<space> you know that the french protestant minister is prepared to marry us the instant news of the divorce shall arrive <space>
<space> whose aspect had been shunned in the prospective <space> assumed at once <space> its true frightful color <space> the blackness of darkness <space> and a lively remorse <space> a never dying anguish <space> took possession of her soul forever <space> oh reader believe me <space>
<space> coolly observed sir francis <space> chance it <space> chance the legitimacy of the child <space> you must assure that before all things <space>
<space> nothing can repair the injury <space> if you once suffer it to come upon him <space> he will be a by word amidst men throughout his life <space> you had better have written to the law lords to urge on the divorce he returned <space> i cannot help the delay <space>
<space> you might not be back in time <space> in time for what <space> oh how can you ask <space> she rejoined in a sharp <space> tone of reproach <space> you know too well <space> in time to make me your wife when the divorce shall appear <space> i shall chance it <space>
<space> and they are both in the same handwriting <space> your solicitors i believe <space> up went his hand at the last word <space> and he made a sort of grab at the letters <space> stalked to the farthest window <space> opened it and glanced over its contents <space> sir <space>
<space> scarcely had she closed the door upon herself and the tray <space> when sir francis levison appeared equipped for traveling <space> good bye isabel <space> said he without further circumlocution or ceremony <space>
<space> now don't put yourself in a <space> fever isabel <space> how many times am i to be compelled to beg that of you <space> it does no good <space> is it my fault if i am called suddenly to england <space> have you no pity for your child <space> she urged in agitation <space>
<space> a stranger might have attributed these signs to the state of her health <space> she knew better <space> knew that they were the effects of her wretched mind and heart <space> it was very late for breakfast <space> but why should she rise early only to drag through another endless day <space>
<space> last out a whole ten months <space> you are in egregious error <space> compliments the very opposite to honey and sweetness <space> have generally supervened long before <space> try it if you don't believe me <space> two letters <space> she continued <space>
<space> furnished <space> in the vicinity of the <space> place grenette <space> a windy old house it was <space> full of doors and windows chimneys and cupboards <space> and he said he should remain there <space> lady isabel remonstrated <space>
<space> she had found herself plunged into a yawning abyss of horror <space> from which <space> there was never more <space> any escape <space> never more <space> never more <space> the very instant <space> the very night of her departure <space> she awoke to what she had done <space> the guilt <space>
<space> we have much pleasure in congratulating you upon your accession <space> to the title and estates <space> and beg to state that should it not be convenient to you to visit england at present <space> we will be happy to transact all necessary matters for you <space>
<space> lady <space> wife <space> mother <space> should you ever be tempted to abandon your home <space> so will you awake <space> whatever trials may be the lot <space> of your married life <space> though they may magnify themselves <space> to your crushed spirit as beyond the nature <space>
<space> in a subdued quiet tone <space> not to draw too near <space> as any little excitement made her faint now <space> he took a seat opposite to her and began pushing the logs together with his boot <space> as he explained that he really could not get away from town before <space>
<space> in seeking a divorce <space> and the announcement that it was granted was now daily expected <space> she was anxious for it <space> anxious that captain levison should render her the only reparation <space> in his power before the birth of her <space> unhappy child <space>
<space> and all the time the sly fox had got the times in his coat pocket <space> but he was only obeying the orders of his master <space> it had been captain levison's recent pleasure <space> that the newspapers should not be seen by lady isabel <space> until he had over looked them <space>
<space> that miladi would soon get about if she would only rouse herself <space> she had got so far about as to sit up in the windy chamber <space> and it seemed to be to her <space> a matter of perfect indifference <space> whether she ever got out of it <space>
<space> misery marks the countenance worse than sickness <space> her face was white and worn <space> her hands were thin <space> her eyes were sunken and surrounded by a black circle <space> care was digging caves for them <space>
<space> the girl departed closing the door <space> and lady isabel sat looking at it <space> schooling her patience <space> another moment and it was flung open <space> sir francis levison approached to greet her as he came in <space> she waved him off <space> begging him <space>
<space> full of windows and doors and draughts <space> with its wide hearth and its wide chimney <space> into which we could put four or five of our english ones <space> shivered lady isabel vane <space> she had an invalid cap on <space> and a thick woolen invalid shawl <space>
<space> lady isabel excited beyond all self control <space> slipped the bolt of the door <space> and half leaning against it <space> half leaning at his feet <space> held up her hand in supplication <space> francis have you any consideration left for me <space> any in the world <space>
<space> nearly an hour elapsed when she remembered the breakfast things and rang for them to be removed <space>
<space> and white <space> and sleety and sloppy <space> the gutters running through the middle of certain of the streets <space> were unusually black <space> and the people crept along especially dismal <space> close to the fire in the barn of a french bedroom <space>
<space> but the instant the step was irrevocable <space> the instant she had left the barrier behind <space> repentance set in <space> even in the first days of her departure <space> in the fleeting moments of abandonment <space> when it may be supposed she might momentarily forget conscience <space>
<space> the decked out dandies before the world are frequently the greatest slovens in domestic privacy <space> he wished her good morning in a careless tone of apathy <space> and she as apathetically answered to it <space> pierre says there are some letters he began <space>
<space> sir <space> after sending off our last dated to day <space> we received tidings of the demise of sir peter levison <space> your grand uncle <space> he expired this afternoon in town <space> where he had come for the benefit of medical advice <space>
<space> on your favoring us with instructions <space> and we remain sir <space> most faithfully yours <space> moss and grab <space> sir francis levison <space> bart <space> the outside of the letter was superscribed as the other <space> f <space> levison <space> esquire <space>
<space> languidly she took her seat at the table <space> just as captain levison's servant <space> a frenchman <space> whom he had engaged in paris <space> entered the room with two letters <space> point de gazette <space> pierre <space>
<space> little thought she that there was not the least intention on his part to make her reparation <space> any more than he had made it to others who had gone before her <space> she had become painfully aware of the fact that the man <space> for whom she had chosen to sacrifice herself <space>
<space> rather than forfeit your fair name and your good conscience <space> for be assured that the alternative <space> if you do rush on to it <space> will be found worse than death <space> poor thing <space> poor lady isabel <space> she had sacrificed husband <space> children <space>
<space> you may drop that odious title isabel which has stuck to me too long <space> i own a better now <space> what one pray <space> you can look and see <space> lady isabel took up the letter and read it <space> sir francis swallowed down his coffee <space> and rang the <space>
<space> table hand bell <space> the only bell you generally meet with in france <space> pierre answered it <space> put me up a change of things said he in french <space> i start for england in an hour <space> it is very well <space> pierre responded and departed to do it <space>
<space> it was over then <space> and all claim to the name of carlyle was declared to have been forfeited by the lady isabel forever <space> captain levison folded up the letter <space> and placed it securely in an inner pocket <space> is there any news <space> she asked <space>
when <space> instead of the garden of roses <space> it had been her persuader's <space> pleasure <space> to promise her she would fall into <space> but which in truth <space> she had barely glanced at <space> for that had not been her moving motive <space>
<space> when a high principled <space> gentlewoman <space> falls from her pedestal <space> never had she experienced a moment's calm <space> or peace <space> or happiness <space> since the fatal night of quitting her home <space> she had taken a blind leap in a moment of wild passion <space>
<space> where is pierre <space> miladi asked <space>
<space> news <space> of the divorce i mean <space> tush <space> was the response of captain levison <space> as if wishing to imply that the divorce was yet <space> a far off affair <space>
<space> the endurance of woman to bear <space> resolve to bear them <space> fall down upon your knees <space> and pray to be enabled to bear them <space> pray for patience <space> pray for strength to resist the demon that would tempt you to escape <space> bear unto death <space>
<space> she wished to go farther on <space> where they might get quicker news from england <space> but her will now was as nothing <space> she was looking like the ghost of her former self <space> talk of her having looked ill when she took that voyage over the water with mister carlyle <space> you should have seen her now <space>
when the door timidly opened <space> and the pretty face of barbara hare appeared at it <space> rosy with blushes <space> can i see mister carlyle <space> mister dill rose from his seat <space> and shook hands with her <space> she drew him into the passage and he closed the door <space> perhaps he felt surprised <space>
<space> she broke off with a look of dread <space> it would be <space> it might be death <space> it is quite impossible calmly replied mister carlyle <space> the doors are double doors <space> did you notice that they were <space> nevertheless <space> she left her chair and stood close to mister carlyle <space>
<space> with its <space> substantial salary <space> sufficient for his ambition <space> and manager he had been to them <space> when the present mister carlyle was in long petticoats <space> he was a single man <space> and occupied handsome apartments near <space>
<space> miss carlyle looked perfectly aghast <space> richard hare <space> is he mad <space> it is not a very sane proceeding <space> he wants money from his mother <space> and missus hare sent barbara to ask me to manage it for her <space>
<space> presently miss barbara <space> he is engaged just now <space> the justices are with him <space> the justices uttered barbara in alarm <space> and papa one <space> whatever shall i do <space> he must not see me <space> i would not have him see me here for the world <space> an ominous sound of talking <space>
<space> i want you to see richard if possible <space> he is coming to the same place to night <space> if he can tell his own tale to you <space> perhaps you may find out a way by which <space> his <space> innocence may be made manifest <space> you are so clever <space> you can do anything <space> mister carlyle smiled <space>
<space> it was mister dill <space> a little <space> meek looking man with a bald head <space> he was on the rolls <space> had been admitted years and years ago <space> but he had never set up for himself <space> perhaps he deemed the post of head manager in the office of carlyle and davidson <space>
<space> the justices were evidently coming forth <space> mister dill laid hold of barbara <space> whisked her through the clerks room <space> not daring to take her the other way <space> lest he should encounter them and shut her in his own <space> what the plague brought papa here at this moment thought barbara <space> whose face was crimson <space>
<space> richard also wishes for an interview <space> it is only natural <space> missus hare must be thankful to hear so far <space> that he is safe <space> i never saw anything like it returned barbara <space> the change is akin to magic <space> she says it has put life into her anew <space> and now for the last thing <space>
<space> he has been in london all this while <space> half starving working <space> i feel ashamed to mention it to you <space> in a stable yard <space> and oh <space> archibald <space> he says he is innocent <space> mister carlyle made no reply to this <space> he probably had no faith in the assertion <space>
<space> who was not well enough to come herself <space> it is a little private matter <space> that she does not wish papa to know of <space> child answered the manager <space> a lawyer receives visits from many people <space> and it is not the place of those about him <space> to think <space> he opened the door as he spoke <space>
<space> no wonder poor barbara was flurried and nervous <space> for there's danger on all sides <space> is he at their house <space> how could he be there and his father in it <space>
<space> in the centre of west lynne stood two houses adjoining each other <space> one large <space> the other much smaller <space> the large one was the carlyle residence <space> and the small one was devoted to the carlyle offices <space> the name of carlyle <space> bore a lofty standing in the county <space>
<space> when dissenting from a problem <space> she was sure there was some mystery astir <space> she turned and walked down the street with barbara <space>
<space> dropping the point of the contest as to the pipes <space> you are very clever archie <space> but you can't <space> do me <space> i asked barbara what she came here for <space> business for mamma <space> touching money matters was her reply <space> i ask you <space>
<space> how can we secure papa's absence from home to night <space> it must be accomplished in some way <space> you know his temper <space> were i or mamma to suggest to him to go and see some friend <space> or to go to the club <space> he would immediately stop at home <space> can you devise any plan <space>
<space> it is nothing that could interest you <space> a trifling matter <space> relating to a little money <space> it's nothing <space> indeed <space> then if it's nothing why were you closeted so long with archibald <space> he was asking the particulars replied barbara recovering her equanimity <space>
<space> the first missus carlyle having been mister davidson's sister <space> she had died and left one child <space> the second missus carlyle died when her son was born <space> archibald <space> and his half sister reared him <space> loved him and ruled him <space>
<space> suppressing all signs of incredulity <space> i don't know <space> a friend of <space> afy's he said <space> archibald he swore to it in the most solemn manner <space> and i believe <space> as truly as <space> that i am now repeating it to you <space> that he was speaking the truth <space>
<space> for his spectacles <space> might be discerned at it more frequently than was agreeable <space> the old gentleman had a desk <space> also in their office <space> and there he frequently sat <space> he was sitting there in state <space> this same morning <space> keeping a sharp lookout around him <space>
<space> and came back with the noted justices at his heels <space> they obeyed the summons with alacrity <space> for they believed they had got themselves into a judicial scrape <space> and that mister carlyle alone <space> could get them out of it <space> i will not request you to sit down began mister carlyle <space>
<space> to hear your opinion about the scrape the bench have got into is yours <space> now it's neither one nor the other and i tell you archibald <space> i'll hear what it is <space> i should like to know what you and barbara do with a secret between you <space> mister carlyle knew her and her resolute expression well <space>
<space> send in miss carlyle first <space> was the answer <space> what is it cornelia <space> ah <space> you may well ask what <space> saying this morning that you could not dine at six as usual and then marching off and never fixing the hour <space>
<space> not quite anything barbara <space> was this the purport of richard's visit <space> to say this <space> oh <space> no <space> he thinks it is of no use to say it <space> for nobody would believe him against the evidence <space> he came to ask for a hundred pounds <space>
<space> mister dill shut me into his room <space> mister carlyle motioned to barbara to seat herself <space> then resumed his own seat beside his table <space> barbara could not help noticing how different his manners were in his office <space> from his evening manners when he was <space> off duty <space>
<space> sit down barbara <space> he said <space> drawing her chair closer <space> barbara sat down again <space> but her manner <space> was hurried and nervous <space> is it quite sure that no stranger will be coming in <space> it would look so peculiar to see me here <space> but mamma was too unwell to come herself <space>
<space> before the clerks <space> or her father <space> mamma wanted mister carlyle's opinion upon a little private business <space> and not feeling well enough to come herself <space> she sent me <space>
<space> come at seven <space> not later <space> and you will find my father's old jar replenished with the best broadcut <space> and half a dozen churchwarden pipes <space> shall it be so <space> the whole five accepted the invitation <space> eagerly <space>
<space> ushered her into the presence of mister carlyle <space> and left her <space> the latter rose in astonishment <space> you must regard me as a client <space> and pardon my intrusion <space> said barbara with a forced laugh <space> to hide her agitation <space> i am here <space> on the part of mamma <space>
<space> mister carlyle returned to his room <space> deliberated a few moments and then rang his bell <space> a clerk answered it <space> go to the buck's head <space> if mister hare and the other magistrates are there <space> ask them to step over to me <space> the young man did as he was bid <space>
<space> you see <space> i appeal to you in <space> all my troubles <space> she added <space> like i and anne used to do when we were children <space> it may be questioned if mister carlyle heard the last remark <space> he had dropped his eyelids in thought <space> have you told me all <space> he asked presently lifting them <space>
<space> had never married <space> it was pretty certain she never would <space> people thought that her intense love of her young brother kept her single <space> for it was not likely that the daughter of the rich mister carlyle had wanted for offers <space> other maidens confess to soft and tender impressions <space>
<space> have you <space> been with archibald for <space> barbara hare <space> wishing miss carlyle over in asia <space> stammered out the excuse she had given mister dill <space> your mamma sent you on business <space> i never heard of such a thing <space> twice i have been to see archibald <space>
<space> with an iron hand <space> she liked to rule him now <space> in great things <space> as in small <space> just as she had done in the days of his babyhood <space> and archibald generally submitted <space> for the force of habit <space> is strong <space> she was a woman of strong sense <space>
<space> resting her hand upon the table <space> he rose of course <space> richard is here <space> richard <space> repeated mister carlyle <space> at west lynne <space> he appeared at the house last night in disguise and made signs to me from the grove of trees <space> you may imagine my alarm <space>
<space> i should have premised that i have not yet told mamma it is richard himself who is here <space> but that he has sent a messenger to beg for this money <space> would it be advisable to acquaint her <space> why should you not <space> i think you ought to do so <space> then i will <space>
<space> sure and certain <space> responded the gratified justice <space> fire and water shouldn't keep me away <space> soon after mister carlyle was left alone <space> another clerk entered <space> miss carlyle is asking to see you sir <space> and colonel bethel's come again <space>
<space> a courtesy probably not yet shown to any client by mister carlyle <space> the house door closed upon her <space> and barbara had taken one step from it <space> when something large loomed <space> down upon her <space> like a ship in full sail <space>
<space> this room is sacred from the intrusion of strangers <space> what of richard <space> he says that he was not in the cottage at the time the murder was committed <space> that the person who really did it was a man of the name of thorn <space> what thorn <space> asked mister carlyle <space>
<space> for it is barely a moment i shall detain you <space> the more i think about this man's having been put in prison <space> the less i like it <space> and i have been considering that you had better all five come and smoke your pipes at my house this evening <space> when we shall have time to discuss what must be done <space>
<space> the rest to his son <space> and in this <space> perhaps there was justice <space> since the twenty thousand pounds brought to mister carlyle by his second wife <space> had been chiefly instrumental in the accumulation of his large fortune <space> miss carlyle <space> or as she was called in town <space> miss corny <space>
<space> and twice did dill answer that he was engaged and must not be interrupted <space> i shall make old dill explain his meaning <space> for observing a mystery over it to me <space> there is no mystery <space> answered barbara <space> feeling quite sick <space> lest miss carlyle should proclaim there was <space>
<space> still <space> if he is to be in the grove to night <space> i may as well be there also <space> what disguise is he in <space> a farm laborer's <space> the best he could adopt about here <space> with large black whiskers <space> he is stopping about three miles off he said <space>
<space> and he took his course to tell her the truth <space> she was <space> to borrow the words barbara had used to her brother with <space> regard to him <space> true as steel <space> confide to miss carlyle a secret <space> and she was trustworthy and impervious as he could be <space>
<space> if he can have that sum <space> mamma has sent me to you <space> she has not the money by her <space> and she dare not ask papa for it <space> as it is for richard <space> she bade me say that if you will kindly oblige her with the money to day <space> she will arrange with you about the repayment <space>
<space> and <space> putting graver considerations aside <space> that would be pleasant for neither you <space> nor for me <space> to have a connection gibbeted for a willful murder <space> would be an <space> ugly blot <space> on the carlyle escutcheon <space> cornelia <space>
<space> i will talk to you at dinner time <space> i have invited a party for to night <space> a party <space> echoed miss carlyle <space> four or five of the justices are coming in to smoke their pipes <space> you must put out your father's leaden tobacco box and <space>
<space> was left <space> equally divided between cornelia <space> and archibald <space> archibald was no blood relation to him <space> but he loved the open hearted boy <space> better than his niece cornelia <space> of mister carlyle's property <space> a small portion only was bequeathed to his daughter <space>
<space> in some obscure hiding place <space> and now <space> continued barbara <space> i want you to advise me <space> had i better inform mamma that richard is here <space> or not <space>
<space> here he saw clients when mister carlyle was out or engaged and here he issued private orders <space> a little window <space> not larger than a pane of glass <space> looked out from the clerk's office <space> they called it old <space> dill's peep hole <space> and wished it anywhere else <space>
<space> contrive to be in the street at four this afternoon <space> stay <space> that's your dinner hour <space> be walking up the street at three <space> three precisely <space> i will meet you <space> he rose <space> shook hands <space> and escorted barbara through the small hall <space> along the passage to the house door <space>
<space> and she would set to work like a ferret <space> and never stop until it was <space> unearthed <space> mister carlyle bent forward and spoke in a whisper <space> i will tell you if you wish cornelia <space> but it is not a pleasant thing to hear <space> richard hare <space> has returned <space>
<space> and will be at the grove to night to receive this money <space> i have invited the justices to get mister hare safe away from his own house <space>
<space> not so miss carlyle <space> all who had approached her with the lovelorn tale <space> she sent quickly to the right about <space> mister carlyle was seated in his own private room in his office the morning after his return from town <space> his confidential clerk and manager stood near him <space>
<space> going down his throat by bucketfuls <space> a hoarse derisive laugh <space> and a hip <space> hip <space> hurrah <space> broke from the actors <space> while the juvenile ragtag in wild delight <space> joined their hands round the pool <space>
<space> you'd have gone into laughing convulsions lucy had you seen the drowned cur <space> i'd give all my tin for six months to come to have a photograph of him as he looked then <space> lucy laughed in glee <space>
<space> was the promise held out in reply to their remonstrances <space> and the lawyer <space> who was short and fat and could not have knocked a man down <space> had it been to save his life <space> backed out of the melee <space> and contented himself with issuing forth confused threatenings of the terrors of the law <space>
<space> his shivery limbs and his dilapidated garments <space> shaking the wet off him <space> the laborers their duty done <space> walked coolly away <space> the tagrag withdrew to a safe distance waiting for what might come next <space> and miss carlyle moved away also <space>
<space> his face turned white <space> and he trembled in his shoes <space> worthless men are frequently cowards <space> lady isabel trembled in hers <space> and well she might <space> hearing that one allusion <space> they set upon him <space> twenty pairs of hands at least <space> strong <space> rough determined hands <space>
<space> miss carlyle laid her hand upon the shrinking arm of her pale companion <space> you see him <space> my brother archibald <space> i see him <space> faltered lady isabel <space> and you see him <space> that pitiful outcast who is too contemptible to live <space>
<space> she pointed <space> out what she wanted done to the old glasses <space> and said she would buy a pair of new ones to wear while the job was about <space> the man had no blue ones <space> no green <space> plenty of white <space> one ugly old <space> pair of green things he had <space>
<space> no <space> poor thing <space> she is gone beyond all doubt <space> and has taken her sins with her <space> convincing proofs <space> and miss carlyle lent her ear to them <space> the following morning while madame vine was at breakfast <space> mister carlyle entered <space>
<space> and with that he burst out crying <space> and gave bill white half a crown out of his pocket <space>
<space> miss corny flew to the window <space> lady isabel in her wake <space> two crowds <space> it may almost be said for <space> from the opposite way the scarlet and purple party as mister carlyle's was called <space> in allusion to his colors came in view <space>
<space> they look as strong as eyes can look <space> but why wear colored glasses <space> white ones would answer every purpose i should suppose <space>
<space> with tortoise shell rims left by some stranger ages and ages ago <space> to be mended and never called for again <space> this very pair of <space> ugly old green things was chosen by lady isabel <space> she put them on <space> there and then <space>
<space> afy saw it if you'll excuse me mentioning her name to you ma'am <space>
<space> stuck his pendent eye glasses astride on the bridge of his nose <space> sir francis levison <space> could it be <space> yes it actually was <space> what on earth had put him into that state <space>
<space> miss carlyle's rooms <space> a fine row we have had in the town joyce this afternoon <space> i have heard of it ma'am <space> served him right if they had let him drown <space> bill white <space> squire pinner's plowman called in here and told us the news <space> he'd have burst with it if he hadn't i expect <space>
<space> do you admit intruders here madame vine <space> cried he with his sweet smile and attractive manner <space> she arose <space> her face burning <space> her heart throbbing <space> keep your seat pray <space> i have but a moment to stay <space> said mister carlyle <space>
<space> and to know <space> that they were separated for ever and ever <space> that she was worse to him <space> than nothing <space>
<space> now miss corny in so speaking <space> had certainly no thought of present and immediate punishment for the gentleman <space> but it appeared that the mob around had <space> the motion was commented by those stout shouldered laborers <space>
<space> or whether their own feelings alone spurred them on <space> was best known to the men themselves <space> certain it is <space> that the ominous sound of <space> duck him <space> was breathed forth by a voice <space> and it was caught up <space> and echoed around <space> duck him <space>
<space> it was my duty to do so <space> there was no one else to undertake it <space> did you ascertain positively beyond all doubt <space> that she did die <space>
<space> half a dozen buffeted him <space> and <space> all <space> abused him <space> in with him boys <space> mercy <space> mercy shrieked the victim <space> his knees bending and his teeth chattering <space> a little mercy for the love of heaven <space> heaven <space> much he knows of heaven <space>
<space> he thought it the strangest question that ever was asked him <space> i scarcely understand you miss carlyle <space> died <space> certainly she died <space> when the result of the accident was communicated to you <space> you made inquiry yourself into its truth <space> its details i believe <space>
<space> he would have borne on without legs at all <space> rather than remain under the enemy's gaze <space> the enemy loftily continued their way <space> their heads in the air and scorning further notice all save young lord vane <space> he hovered round the ranks of the unwashed <space>
<space> where are you going madame <space> they were passing a spectacle shop <space> and madame vine had halted at the door <space> one foot on its step <space> i must have my glasses to be mended if you please <space> miss carlyle followed her in <space>
<space> i never saw a chap so excited <space> peter cried <space> cried echoed miss carlyle <space> well ma'am <space> you know he was very fond of lady isabel was peter <space> and somehow his feelings overcame him <space> he said he had not heard anything to please him so much for many a day <space>
<space> had any error occurred at that time <space> any false report of her death <space> i should soon have found it out by her drawing the annuity i settled upon her <space> it has never been drawn since <space> besides <space> she would have written to me as agreed upon <space>
<space> ma'am <space> repeated joyce <space> in some surprise as it appeared <space> the governess <space> do you mean madame vine <space> do i mean you or do i mean me are we governesses <space> irascibly cried miss corny <space> who should i mean but madame vine <space>
<space> francis levison would have stopped in the pond of his own accord head downward rather than <space> face them <space> miss carlyle went that day to dine at <space> east lynne <space>
<space> and i can tell you joyce <space> that i was confounded at the likeness <space> it is an extraordinary likeness <space>
<space> you can remind doctor martin <space> that the child's constitution is precisely what his mother's was <space> continued mister carlyle <space> a tinge lightening his face <space> it may be a guide to his treatment <space> he said himself it was when he attended him for an illness a year or two ago <space>
<space> duck him <space> the pond be close at hand <space> let's give him a taste of his deservings <space>
<space> miss carlyle stood her ground majestically and looked on with a grim countenance <space> had she interfered for his protection <space> she could not have been heard <space> and if she could have been <space> there's no knowing whether she would have done it <space> on to the brink of the pond <space>
<space> that evening after dinner miss carlyle and lord mount severn sat side by side on the same sofa <space> coffee cups in hand <space> miss carlyle turned to the earl <space> was it a <space> positively ascertained fact that lady isabel died <space> the earl stared with all his might <space>
<space> i am as sure that she is dead as that we are living <space> decisively replied the earl <space> and he spoke but according to his belief <space> wherefore should you be inquiring this <space> a thought came over me <space> only to day <space> to wonder whether she was really dead <space>
<space> not to speak of the tagrag's help <space> who went in with cuffs and kicks and pokes and taunts and cheers and a demoniac dance <space> they dragged him through a gap in the hedge <space> a gap that no baby could have got through in a cool moment <space> but most of us know the difference between coolness and excitement <space>
<space> while the mob behind had swollen to the length of the street and was keeping up a perpetual fire of <space> derisive shouts groans and hisses <space> the scarlet and purple halted in consternation and lord mount severn whose sight was not as good as it had been twenty years back <space>
<space> a green dank <space> dark slimy sour stinking pond <space> his coat tails were gone by this time <space> and sundry rents and damages appeared in <space> in another useful garment <space> one pulled him another pushed him <space> a third shook him by the collar <space>
<space> i have come to ask you how william seems <space> there was no difference <space> she murmured <space> and then she took courage and spoke more openly <space> i understood you to say the other night sir <space> that he should have further advice <space> ay <space> i wish him to go over to lynneborough <space> to doctor martin <space>
<space> they had never had such a play acted for them before <space> out of the pea soup <space> before he was quite dead <space> quite senseless <space> of all drowned rats <space> he looked the worst as he stood there with his white rueful face <space>
<space> joyce was silent <space> to contradict miss corny brought triumph to nobody <space> and she was conscious <space> in her innermost heart <space> that afy merited <space> a little wholesome correction <space> not perhaps to the extent of a ducking <space>
<space> and looked vastly inclined to enter upon an indian jig <space> on his own account <space> what a thundering ass i was to try it on at west lynne <space> was the enraged comment of the sufferer <space>
<space> who or <space> what <space> was that object in advance of it <space> supported between drake and the lawyer <space> and looking like a drowned rat <space> hair hanging legs tottering <space> cheeks <space> shaking and clothes in tatters <space>
<space> when miss carlyle was in her dressing room taking her things off <space> the room where once had slept richard hare <space> she rang for joyce <space> these two rooms were still kept for miss carlyle <space> for she did sometimes visit them for a few days <space> and were distinguished by her name <space>
<space> she was coming here with a message from missus latimer to the governess <space> what did she go into hysterics for <space> again snapped miss carlyle <space> it upset her so she said returned joyce <space> it wouldn't have done her harm had they ducked her too <space> was the angry response <space>
<space> miss carlyle's eyes searching her face inquisitively <space> all the time <space> why do you wear glasses <space> began miss corny abruptly as soon as they were indoors <space> another deep flush and an imperceptible hesitation <space> my eyes are not strong <space>
<space> quite a collection of gentlemen <space> mister carlyle and lord mount severn heading them <space> what could it mean <space> the mob they were encountering <space>
<space> wondering how he should get to the raven <space> an empty fly drove past and mister drake immediately stopped it <space> but when the driver saw that he was expected to convey not only a passenger but a tolerable quantity of water as well <space> and that the passenger moreover was sir francis levison <space>
<space> you may wonder that the submerged gentleman should be walking through the streets on his way to his quarters <space> the raven inn <space> for he had been ejected from the buck's head <space> but he could not help himself <space> as he was dripping and swearing on the brink of the pond <space>
<space> the drive i think will do him good <space> replied mister carlyle <space> and i would like you to accompany him if you do not mind the trouble <space> you can have the pony carriage <space>
<space> turn himself up at west lynne for <space> bearding mister carlyle <space> what have he done with lady isabel <space> him <space> put up for others at west lynne <space> west lynne's respectable <space> it don't want him <space> it have got a better man <space> it won't have a villain <space> now lads <space>
<space> she turned herself round from the looking glass and gazed full in joyce's face waiting for the answer <space> joyce lowered her voice as she gave it <space>
<space> mister carlyle's lip curled <space> he continued his way and drew the peer with him <space> what the deuce is a gate now <space> called out the followers of mister carlyle <space> that's levison <space> has he been in a railway smash and got drenched by the engine <space>
<space> and that the shortest way would be to hasten to the inn on foot <space> he objected <space> but his jaws were chattering his limbs were quaking so they seized him between them and made off <space> but never bargained for the meeting of mister carlyle and his party <space>
<space> yes sir <space> he crossed the hall on his entrance to the breakfast room <space> she tore upstairs to her chamber <space> and sank down in an agony of tears and despair <space> oh <space> to love him as she did now <space> to yearn after his affection with this passionate <space> jealous longing <space>
<space> he has been <space> ducked <space> grinned the yellows in answer <space> they have been and ducked him in the rush pool on mister justice hare's land <space> the soaked and miserable man increased his speed as much as his cold and trembling legs would allow him <space>
<space> lord vane found them out <space> and returned at the same time <space> of course <space> east lynne was the headquarters of himself and his father <space> he was in the seventh heaven <space> and had been ever since the encounter with the yellows <space>
<space> miss corny paused <space> what is your christian name madame <space> began she again <space> jane <space> replied madame <space> popping out an unflinching story in her alarm <space> here <space> here <space> what's up <space> what's this <space>
<space> a pause <space> miss carlyle was ruminating <space> but she returned to the charge as if difficult to be convinced <space> you deem that there could be no possibility of an error <space> you are sure <space> that she is dead <space>
<space> she sailed on with her head up <space> though it was turned occasionally to look at the face of madame vine <space> at the deep distressing blush which this gaze called into her cheeks <space> it's very odd <space> thought miss corny <space> the likeness <space> especially in the eyes is <space>
<space> naturally prone <space> to believe <space> necessity thus <space> imposed <space> by prudence <space> nerveless and faithless folly <space>
<space> little less <space> than scandalous <space> lofty <space> and distinguished <space> simplicity <space> long sighted continuity <space> of thought <space> and plan <space>

<space> looking <space> at the matter <space> by <space> and <space> large <space>
<space> he turned the pages and ran his finger down the line of <space> fs <space> find me if you can <space> a count ferralti in the list <space> uncle john looked <space> he put on his glasses and looked again <space>
<space> as they entered the pretty circular hall devoted to the dance <space> louise gave a start of surprise <space>
<space> the count twirled his small and slender moustaches <space> in a way that patsy thought <space> affected <space> and said in <space> excellent english <space>
<space> introducing him to uncle john and her cousins <space> as count <space> ferralti <space> whom she had once met in new york <space> while he was on a visit to america <space>
<space> he carefully placed the card in his pocket <space> book <space> thank you said he <space> it's a fine morning count <space> charming mister merrick <space> uncle john walked away <space> he was glad that he had <space> not suspected the <space> young man unjustly <space>
<space> my dear signor <space> there is no man better posted as to our nobility in <space> all <space> italy <space> yet <space> you say you don't know the ferralti family <space>
<space> has never before heard of <space> him <space> how singular exclaimed louise <space> i wonder why he has tried to deceive us <space> oh the world is full of impostors <space> but when you are on to their game <space> they are <space> quite harmless <space>
<space> who seemed very proud of their accomplishment <space> and anxious to please the throng of <space> tourists present <space> the tarantella originated in ischia <space> but <space> sorrento and capri <space> have <space> the best dancers <space>
<space> and no such noble family signor merrick <space> uncle john whistled softly and walked away to the window <space> the young man greeted him with a smile and a bow <space> i misunderstood your name last evening he said <space> i thought you were count ferralti <space>
<space> uncle john hardly knew what to say <space> further <space> he felt he was in an awkward position for <space> louise was the most experienced in worldly ways of his three nieces <space> and he had no desire to <space> pose as a stern guardian <space>
<space> but <space> there was something in the appearance of <space> this callow italian nobleman that stamped his character as artificial <space> and insincere <space> he resolved to find out something about his antecedents before he permitted <space> the young fellow <space>
<space> observe signor <space> here is our record <space> of nobility <space> it is the same as the blue book <space> or the peerage <space> of <space> england <space> either fortunately <space> or <space> unfortunately <space> i cannot say <space> you have no need <space> of such a book in america <space>
<space> or to deprive his girls of any passing pleasure they might <space> enjoy <space> moreover <space> louise being in love <space> with that young weldon <space> her mother so strongly objected to <space>
<space> a goodly audience had already assembled in the room and among them the girl seemed to recognize <space> an acquaintance <space> for after a brief hesitation she advanced <space> and placed her hand in that of a gentleman <space> who had risen on her entrance and hastened <space> toward <space> her <space>
<space> he was a nice looking young fellow <space> beth thought <space> and had a foreign and quite distinguished <space> air <space> presently louise turned with cheeks somewhat flushed <space> and brought the gentleman to her party <space>
<space> that <space> i cannot tell you signor merrick <space> oh <space> perhaps you know little about the nobility of your country <space> i <space> i know little of the nobility <space> answered floriano indignantly <space>
<space> count ferralti <space> the <space> young man standing by the window yonder <space> i <space> i did not know he said <space> hesitatingly <space> the gentleman arrived last evening and i had not yet learned his name <space> let me see <space>
<space> afterward uncle john and his nieces stood upon the terrace <space> and watched the volcano rolling its dense clouds <space> mingled with sparks of red hot scoria <space> toward <space> the sky <space>
<space> i do not imagine we shall see much of this young man <space> in any event <space> and now <space> that you are well aware of the fact that he is <space> sailing under false colors <space> you will know how to handle him better <space> than <space> i can advise you <space>
<space> then he remarked <space> that the eruption of vesuvius was waning <space> and the trouble nearly over for this time <space>
<space> chapter nine <space> count ferralti <space>
<space> the count clung to louise's side <space> but also tried to make himself agreeable to her cousins <space>
<space> that gave him an excuse to talk with <space> the man <space> who spoke very good english and was exceedingly courteous to his guests <space> especially when they were american <space>
<space> at dinner it was announced that the famous tarantella would be danced in the lower hall of the hotel at nine o'clock <space> and the girls told uncle john that they must not miss this famous sight <space> which is one of the most unique in sorrento <space> or indeed <space> in all italy <space>
<space> count ferralti found a place beside louise <space> but seemed to have little to say to her during the course of the entertainment <space> the dances were unique and graceful being executed <space> by a troup of laughing peasants dressed in native costume <space>
<space> and beth replied that his manners were so like those of their cousin louise <space> that the two ought to get along nicely together <space> uncle john liked his nieces to make friends <space> and encouraged young men generally to meet <space> them <space>
<space> she would not be likely to care much for this italian fellow <space> and missus merrick had enjoined <space> him to keep <space> her daughter's mind <space> from dwelling <space> on her <space> entanglement <space> oh well my dear he said to her <space> you must act as you see fit <space>
<space> he turned to his list of guests <space> who register by card and not in a book and continued <space>
<space> said louise slowly <space> as she resumed her writing <space> well then girls <space> what do you say to a stroll around the village <space> asked <space> their uncle <space> i'm told it's a proper place to buy silk stockings <space> and <space> inlaid wood work <space> they come assorted <space> i suppose <space>
<space> he is neither <space> a count <space> nor of noble family <space> although <space> i suppose when you met him in new york <space> he had an object in posing as a titled aristocrat <space> the girl paused examining the point of her <space> pen thoughtfully <space>
<space> and that is right sir <space> was the prompt reply <space> allow me to offer you my card <space> uncle john took the card and read <space> conte leonardi <space> ferralti <space> milano <space> italia <space>
<space> to establish friendly relations <space> with his girls <space> next morning after breakfast he wandered through the lobby <space> and paused at the little office where he discovered <space> that the proprietor <space> of this hotel was <space> a brother of <space> that floriano <space> who managed the hotel du vesuve <space>
<space> he has given his name as <space> ferralti <space> but added no title <space> a count <space> did you say <space> yes replied uncle john <space> the proprietor looked <space> curiously toward the young man <space> whose back only was visible <space>
<space> when an imposture is unmasked <space> it is no longer dangerous <space> he joined his nieces <space> who were all busily engaged in writing letters home <space> and remarked <space> casually <space> you've been deceived in your italian friend louise <space>
<space> new york adopts a good many said uncle john drily <space> it has even been thoughtless enough to adopt me <space> the dancers entered at that moment <space> and the americans were forced to seat themselves <space> hastily <space> so as not to obstruct the view <space> of <space> others <space>
<space> habitual self possession and self respect <space> happy <space> and gracious willingness <space> hard souled and joyously joyous <space>

<space> and <space> undiscouraged hope <space> high handed <space> indifference to <space> all restraint <space>
<space> he poured <space> bitter <space> and biting ridicule on his discomfited <space> opponents <space> he spoke with sledgehammer directness <space>
<space> excruciating cruelty and injustice <space> exposed <space> to damaging criticism <space> exposing his <space> arrogance and folly <space> to merited contempt <space>

<space> entirely futile <space> and negligible <space>
<space> full <space> of speculation <space> and a deep restrained excitement <space>
<space> he had <space> the habit <space> of self engrossed <space> silences <space>
<space> greeted <space> with <space> unalloyed satisfaction <space> grooves <space> of <space> intellectual habit <space> growing sense of bewilderment and dismay <space>
<space> fanatical and dangerous excesses <space> far off <space> and incredibly remote <space> fastidious correctness <space> of form <space>
<space> his first zeal was flagging <space> his general attitude suggested an idea <space> that he had an oration for you <space>
<space> he turned on me <space> a glance of stored intelligence <space> he was disheveled <space> and <space> untidy <space>
<space> glances and smiles of <space> tacit contempt <space> gnawing <space> at the vitals of society <space> grace <space> and gentleness of <space> manner <space>

<space> he suffers nothing <space> to draw him aside <space> he <space> took his courage <space> in both hands <space>
<space> fate had <space> turned and twisted <space> a thousand ways <space> fed <space> by many currents from the long stream <space> of human experience <space>
<space> generous <space> to a <space> pathetic <space> and <space> touching degree <space> give vent <space> to his indignation <space> giving an ear to a little neighborly gossip <space>
<space> his gestures <space> and his gait <space> were <space> untidy <space> his mood <space> was one of pure <space> exaltation <space>
<space> graceful succession of sentences <space>
<space> her voice had a wooden resonance <space> and a <space> ghost <space> of a lisp <space>

<space> he was <space> inexhaustibly voluble <space>

<space> it would be superfluous to say <space> it would not seem an improbable conclusion <space>

<space> in seasons of <space> difficulty <space> and trial <space> in spite of plausible <space> arguments <space> in <space> terms of <space> imperishable beauty <space>
<space> it dissipates every <space> doubt <space> and scruple <space> it enslaves the imagination <space> it extorted from him expressions of irritability <space>

<space> which <space> influenced <space> their actions <space> the cottagers <space> arose <space> the next morning before the sun <space> the young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food <space> and the youth departed after the first meal <space>
<space> and brought home firing sufficient for the <space> consumption of several days <space>
<space> and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring <space> the art <space> of language <space> my organs were indeed harsh but supple <space> and although my voice was very unlike the soft <space> music of their tones <space> yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable <space> ease <space>
<space> to discover myself <space> to the cottagers <space>
<space> i perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain <space> smiles or sadness <space> in the minds <space> and countenances <space> of the hearers <space> this was indeed <space> a <space> godlike science <space> and i ardently <space> desired to become acquainted with it <space>
<space> when they were unhappy i felt depressed <space> when they rejoiced i sympathized in their joys <space>
<space> as yet to understand or apply them <space> such as good <space> dearest <space> unhappy <space> i spent the winter in this manner <space> the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers <space> greatly endeared them to me <space>
<space> happy happy earth <space> fit habitation for gods which <space> so short a time before <space>
<space> and duty <space> with gentleness <space> and he rewarded them <space>
<space> and they procured a sufficiency of it <space> several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden <space> which they dressed <space> and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced <space> the old man leaning on his son <space>
<space> he read to the old man and agatha <space> this reading had puzzled me <space> extremely at first <space> but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read <space> as when he talked <space> i conjectured therefore <space>
<space> from beneath the snowy ground <space> early in the morning <space> before she had risen <space>
<space> but if his countenance was <space> more sorrowful <space>
<space> this day was passed in the same routine <space> as that which preceded it <space> the young man was constantly employed out of doors <space> and the girl in various laborious occupations within <space> the old man whom i soon perceived to be blind <space>
<space> this trait of kindness moved me sensibly <space> i had been accustomed during the night <space> to steal a part of their store for my own consumption <space>
<space> when they had retired to rest if there was any moon or the night was star light <space>
when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds <space> and was able to pronounce them <space>
<space> my mode of life in my hovel was uniform <space> during the morning i attended the motions of the cottagers <space> and when they were dispersed in various occupations i slept <space> the remainder of the day was spent <space> in observing my friends <space>
<space> and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel <space> i discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse <space> i learned and applied the words fire <space> milk <space> bread <space> and wood <space>
<space> agatha listened with respect <space> her eyes sometimes filled with tears <space> which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived <space>
<space> not having any <space> apparent connection with visible objects <space> i was unable to discover any clue by which <space> i could unravel the mystery of their reference <space> by great application however <space>
<space> as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer <space>
<space> the young woman <space> when she opened the door in the morning <space>
<space> but i was baffled in every attempt i made for this purpose <space>
<space> a considerable period elapsed <space>
<space> it was poverty <space> and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree <space> their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden <space> and the milk of one cow <space> which gave very little <space> during the winter <space>
<space> from this time felix was more employed <space> and the heart moving indications of impending famine disappeared <space>
<space> i abstained <space> and satisfied myself with berries <space> nuts and roots <space> which i gathered from a neighbouring wood <space>
<space> often endeavoured to encourage his children <space> as sometimes i found that he called them <space> to cast off their melancholy <space>
<space> by degrees i made a discovery <space> of still greater moment <space> i found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another <space> by articulate sounds <space>
<space> they were not entirely happy <space> the young man and his companion often went apart <space> and appeared to weep <space> i saw no cause for their unhappiness <space> but i was deeply affected by it <space> if such lovely creatures were miserable <space>
<space> greatly altered the aspect of the earth <space> men who before this change <space> seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves <space> and were employed in various <space> arts of cultivation <space>
<space> that he found <space> on the paper signs for speech which he understood <space> and i ardently longed to comprehend these also <space> but how was that possible when i did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs <space> i improved however <space> sensibly in this science <space>
<space> where to his perpetual astonishment <space> he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand <space> in the day i believe he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer <space> because he often went forth <space> and did not return until dinner <space> yet brought no wood with him <space>
<space> which knowledge might enable me <space> to make them overlook the deformity of my figure <space>
<space> my thoughts now became more <space> active <space> and i longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures <space> i was inquisitive to know why felix appeared so miserable <space> and agatha so sad <space> i thought foolish wretch <space>
<space> i lay on my straw but i could not sleep <space> i thought of the occurrences of the day <space> what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people <space> and i longed to join them but dared not <space>
<space> employed his leisure hours on his instrument <space> or in contemplation <space> nothing could exceed the love and respect <space> which <space> the younger cottagers <space> exhibited towards their venerable companion <space>
<space> when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it <space> they often i believe suffered the pangs of hunger <space> very poignantly <space> especially the two younger cottagers <space> for several times they placed food before the old man <space> when they reserved none for themselves <space>
<space> of conversation <space> although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour <space>
<space> it was less strange that i <space> an imperfect and solitary being <space> should be wretched <space> yet why were these gentle beings unhappy <space>
<space> she uttered some words in a loud voice <space> and the youth joined her <space> who also expressed surprise <space> i observed <space> with pleasure <space> that he did not go to the forest that day <space> but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden <space>
<space> that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people <space> when i slept or was absent <space> the forms of the venerable <space> blind father <space>
<space> especially when he addressed the old man <space> i could mention innumerable instances which <space> although slight <space>
<space> my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature <space>
<space> but the old man had only one <space> which was father <space> the girl was called sister <space> or <space> agatha <space> and the youth felix <space> brother <space> or son <space> i cannot describe the delight i felt <space>
<space> in the midst of poverty and want <space>
<space> and tone were more cheerful <space> after having listened <space> to the exhortations of her father <space> it was not <space> thus with felix <space> he was always the saddest of the group <space> and even to my <space> unpractised senses he appeared to have suffered more deeply <space> than his friends <space>
<space> they were dressed in excellent clothes <space> and still more <space> they enjoyed one another's company and speech <space> interchanging each <space> day looks of affection and kindness <space> what did their tears imply <space>
<space> i imagined that they would be disgusted until <space>
<space> and once or twice i heard them on these occasions <space> utter the words <space> good spirit <space> wonderful <space>
<space> or even why there were laws and governments <space> but when i heard details of vice and bloodshed <space> my wonder ceased <space> and i turned away with disgust <space> and loathing <space> every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me <space>
<space> he had chosen this work he said because the <space> declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors <space>
<space> united with <space> riches <space> a man might be respected <space> with only one of these advantages <space> but without either he was considered <space> except in very rare instances <space> as a vagabond and a slave <space> doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few <space>
<space> i had never yet seen a being resembling me <space> or who claimed any intercourse with me <space> what was i <space>
<space> miserable <space> unhappy wretch <space> other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply <space>
<space> in the countenances of my friends <space> safie was always gay and happy <space> she and i improved rapidly in the knowledge of language <space> so that in two months i began to comprehend most of the words <space> uttered by my protectors <space>
<space> and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished <space> the arabian sat at the feet of the old man <space> and taking his guitar played some airs so entrancingly beautiful <space> that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes <space>
<space> the lady was dressed in a dark suit <space> and covered with a thick black veil <space> agatha asked a question <space> to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing <space> in a sweet accent the name of felix <space>
<space> the book from which felix instructed safie was volney's ruins of empires <space> i should not have understood the <space> purport of this book had not felix in reading it <space>
<space> was the subject of their conversation <space> i ardently desired to understand them <space> and bent <space> every faculty towards that purpose but found it utterly impossible <space> the next morning felix went out to his work <space>
<space> except through means <space> which i obtained by stealth <space>
<space> that i observed the countenance of felix <space> was melancholy beyond expression <space> he sighed frequently <space> and once his father paused in his music <space> and i conjectured <space>
<space> it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom <space> with the most beautiful flowers and verdure <space>
<space> on hearing this word felix came up hastily to the lady <space> who when she saw him <space> threw up her veil <space>
<space> how the father doted on the smiles of the infant <space>
<space> sensations of hunger <space> thirst and heat <space> of what a strange nature is knowledge <space>
<space> inhabitants <space> these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings <space> was man indeed at once so powerful so virtuous and magnificent <space> yet so vicious and base <space>
<space> i now hasten to the more moving part of my story <space> i shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which <space> from what <space> i had <space> been <space> have <space> made me <space> what i am <space>
<space> retired early <space> when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said good night sweet safie <space> he sat up <space> much longer <space> conversing with his father <space> and by the frequent repetition of her name <space> i conjectured <space> that their lovely guest <space>
<space> a condition more abject <space> than <space> that <space>
<space> and her complexion wondrously fair <space>
<space> although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun <space> for i never ventured abroad during daylight <space>
<space> she appeared affected by different feelings wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes <space>
<space> presently i found by the frequent recurrence of some sound <space> which the stranger repeated after them <space> that she was endeavouring to learn their language <space> and the idea instantly occurred to me <space> that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end <space>
<space> every trait of sorrow vanished from his face <space> and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic <space> joy <space> of which i could hardly have believed it capable <space>
<space> she was neither understood <space> by nor herself <space> understood the cottagers <space> they made many signs which i did not comprehend <space> but i saw that her presence <space> diffused gladness through the cottage <space> dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists <space>
<space> and pointing to her brother <space> made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful <space> until she came <space> some hours passed thus while they <space> by their countenances <space> expressed joy <space> the cause of which i did not comprehend <space>
<space> i heard of the division of property <space> of immense wealth and squalid poverty <space> of rank <space> descent <space> and noble blood <space>
<space> all my past life was now a blot <space> a blind vacancy in which <space> i distinguished nothing <space> from my earliest remembrance i had been as i <space> then was in height <space> and proportion <space>
<space> my senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight <space> and a thousand sights of beauty <space> it was on one of these days when my cottagers periodically rested from labour <space> the old man played on his guitar <space>
<space> and a view of the several empires at present <space> existing in the world <space> it gave me an insight into the manners governments and religions <space> of the different nations of the earth <space>
<space> and at another <space> as all that can be conceived of <space> noble <space> and godlike <space> to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being <space> to be base and vicious <space> as many on record have been <space> appeared <space>
<space> in the meanwhile <space> also <space> the black ground was covered with herbage <space> and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers <space> sweet to the scent <space> and the eyes <space> stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods <space> the sun became warmer <space> the nights clear and balmy <space>
<space> the days now passed as peaceably as before <space> with the sole alteration that <space>
<space> that he inquired the cause of his son's sorrow <space> felix replied in a cheerful accent <space> and the old man <space> was recommencing his music <space> when someone tapped at the door <space> it was a lady on horseback <space> accompanied by a country man as a guide <space>
<space> she did not appear to understand him but smiled <space> he assisted her to dismount and dismissing her guide <space> conducted her into the cottage <space>
<space> when she had finished she gave the guitar to agatha <space> who at first declined it <space> she played a simple air <space> and her voice accompanied it <space> in sweet accents <space> but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger <space>
<space> who understood very little and conversed in broken accents <space> whilst i comprehended <space> and could imitate almost every word that was spoken <space> while i improved in speech <space> i also learned the science of letters <space> as it was taught to the stranger <space> and this opened before me <space>
<space> and that was death <space> a state which i feared yet did not understand <space>
<space> no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses <space>
<space> degenerating <space> of the decline of that mighty empire <space> of chivalry <space> christianity and kings <space> i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere <space>
<space> the old man appeared enraptured <space> and said some words which agatha <space> endeavoured to explain to safie <space> and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him <space> the greatest delight by her music <space>
<space> and would have kissed his hand <space> but he raised her and embraced her <space> affectionately <space>
<space> my days were spent in close attention that i might more speedily <space> master the language <space> and i may boast <space>
<space> and what was i <space> of my creation <space> and creator i was absolutely ignorant <space> but i knew that i possessed no money <space> no friends <space> no kind of property <space>
<space> the youth began not to play <space> but to utter sounds <space> that were monotonous <space> and neither resembling the harmony of the old man's instrument <space> nor the songs of the birds <space>
<space> in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers <space> but quickly drew it out again <space> with a cry of pain <space> how strange i thought <space> that the same cause should produce such opposite effects <space> i examined the materials of the fire <space>
<space> one day when i was oppressed by cold <space> i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars <space> and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it <space>
<space> as it were instinctively <space> finding myself so desolate <space>
<space> presently i saw the young man again with some tools in his hand <space> cross the field behind the cottage <space>
<space> and knew not how to reproduce it <space> i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty <space>
<space> who taking up an instrument began to play <space> and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush <space> or the nightingale <space> it was a lovely sight <space>
<space> the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager <space>
<space> the moon <space> i gazed with a kind of wonder <space> it moved slowly <space> but it enlightened my path <space> and i again went out in search of berries <space> i was still cold <space> when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak <space>
<space> by a loaf of coarse bread <space> which i purloined <space> and a cup <space>
<space> and he showed her a large loaf <space> and a piece of cheese <space> she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants <space> which she placed in water <space> and then upon the fire <space>
<space> i gradually saw plainly <space> the clear stream that supplied me with drink <space> and the trees that shaded me with their foliage <space>
<space> i <space> struck across the wood towards the setting sun <space> i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country <space> a great fall of snow had taken place the night before <space>
<space> with a pail on her head <space> passing <space> before my hovel <space> the girl was young and of <space> gentle demeanour <space>
<space> his appearance different from any i had ever before seen <space> and his flight somewhat surprised me <space>
<space> and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees <space> i tried therefore to dress my food in the same manner <space> placing it on the live embers <space>
<space> my eyes became accustomed to the light <space> and to perceive objects in their right forms <space> i distinguished the insect from the herb <space> and by degrees one herb from another <space>
<space> i observed this also <space>
<space> when they were nearly extinguished <space> when night came again i found with pleasure that the fire gave light as well as heat <space> and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food <space>
<space> this was the forest near ingolstadt <space> and here i lay by the side of a brook <space> resting from my fatigue until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst <space> this roused me from my nearly dormant state <space>
<space> and then spreading my cloak <space> i lay on the ground and sank into sleep <space> it was morning when i awoke <space> and my first care was to visit the fire <space>
<space> and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots <space>
<space> the light poured in upon me again <space> i walked and i believe descended <space> but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations <space> before dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me <space>
<space> the rain dropping branches and dank earth <space> i ate my breakfast with pleasure <space> and was about to remove a plank <space> to procure myself a little water <space> when i heard a step <space> and looking through a small chink i beheld a young creature <space>
<space> and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof <space>
<space> that i might view the adjacent cottage <space>
<space> by degrees i remember a stronger light pressed upon my nerves <space> so that i was obliged to shut my eyes <space> darkness then came over me <space> and troubled me <space> but hardly had i felt this when by opening my eyes <space> as i now suppose <space>
<space> i slaked my thirst at the brook <space> and then lying down <space> was overcome by sleep <space> it was dark when i awoke <space> i felt <space> cold also and half frightened <space>
<space> and the nuts and roots <space> much improved <space>
<space> one part was open <space> and by that i had crept in <space> but now <space> i covered every crevice by which <space> i might be perceived with stones and wood <space>
<space> the moon had disappeared from the night <space> and again with a lessened form showed itself <space> while <space> i still remained in the forest <space> my sensations had by this time become distinct <space> and my mind received every day additional ideas <space>
<space> when i found this <space> i resolved to <space> quit <space> the place that i had hitherto inhabited <space> to seek for one where the few wants i experienced <space>
<space> no wood however was placed on the earth which formed the floor <space> but it was dry <space> and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks <space> i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain <space>
<space> the meal was quickly dispatched <space> the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage <space> the old man walked <space> before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes <space> leaning on the arm of the youth <space> nothing could exceed in beauty <space> the contrast between these two excellent creatures <space>
<space> the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon <space> and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure <space> several changes of day <space> and night passed <space> and the orb of night had greatly lessened <space> when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other <space>
<space> the old man had in the meantime been pensive <space> but on the appearance of his companions <space>
<space> which shone brightly on the white ground <space>
<space> bearing on his shoulders a load of wood <space> the girl met him at the door <space> helped <space> to relieve him of his burden <space> and taking some of the fuel into the cottage <space> placed it on the fire <space> then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage <space>
<space> sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds <space> but was unable <space> sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode <space> but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me <space> frightened me into silence again <space>
<space> and i withdrew from the window <space> unable to bear these emotions <space>
<space> refuge in a low hovel <space> quite bare <space> and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village <space> this hovel however joined a cottage <space> of a neat and pleasant appearance <space> but after my <space> late dearly bought experience i dared not enter it <space>
<space> her fair hair was plaited but not <space> adorned <space> she looked <space> patient yet sad <space>
<space> having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it <space> with clean straw <space> i retired for i saw the figure of a man at a distance <space> and i remembered too well my treatment the <space> night before <space> to trust myself <space> in his power <space>
<space> all the light i enjoyed <space> came through the sty <space>
<space> this was a new sight to me <space> and i examined the structure with great curiosity <space> finding the door open i entered <space> an old man sat in it near a fire over which he was preparing his breakfast <space> he turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shrieked loudly <space>
<space> did not put an end to the pleasure <space> i experienced in watching my human neighbours <space>
<space> he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection <space> that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature <space>
<space> which flowed by my retreat <space> the floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry <space> and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage <space> it was tolerably warm <space>
<space> no distinct ideas occupied my mind all was <space> confused <space> i felt light and hunger and thirst <space> and darkness <space> innumerable sounds rang in my ears <space> and on all sides various scents saluted me <space>
<space> after their sufferings in the lake of fire <space> i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast <space> which <space> consisted of bread <space> cheese milk and wine <space> the latter however i did not like <space> then overcome <space>
<space> the wet wood <space> which i had placed near the heat <space> dried and itself became inflamed <space> i reflected on this <space> and by touching the various branches <space>
<space> whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture <space> in one corner near a small fire sat an old man <space> leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude <space> the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage but presently <space>
<space> allured my appetite <space> one of the best of these i entered <space> but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked <space> and one of the women fainted <space> the whole village was roused <space> some fled <space> some attacked me <space>
<space> the appearance was <space> disconsolate <space> and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance <space> that covered the ground <space> it was about seven in the morning and i longed to obtain food and shelter <space> at length i perceived <space> a small hut <space>
<space> however miserable from the inclemency of the season <space> and still more from the barbarity of man <space>
<space> i had covered myself with some clothes <space> but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night <space>
<space> the light became more and more oppressive to me <space>
<space> which often saluted my ears <space> proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals <space>
<space> chapter eleven <space> it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my being <space>
<space> and in about a quarter of an hour <space> she returned bearing the pail which was now partly filled with milk <space> as she walked along <space>
<space> i knew and could distinguish nothing <space> but feeling pain invade me on all sides <space> i sat down and wept <space> soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of <space> pleasure <space>
<space> i lay <space> down among some straw <space> and fell asleep <space>
<space> on examining my dwelling <space> i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it <space> but the panes had been filled up with wood <space> in one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which <space> the eye could just penetrate <space>
<space> i proceeded across the fields for several hours <space> until at sunset <space> i arrived at a village <space>
<space> but <space> to my extreme wonder <space>
<space> the prince begged for a foal of the mare which the mother dragon at once gave him and <space> over and above <space> a <space> cloak made of gold for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty <space> so in the evening he appeared at the ball in his golden cloak <space>
<space> who has been captured <space> by a dragon <space> if you wish to marry her you must first set her free <space> and <space> this <space> i will help you to do <space> i will give you this little bell <space> if you <space> ring it <space> once <space>
<space> she said to him <space> you <space> are a brave <space> youth <space> and i will make you my body servant <space> but what <space> shall i give you as a reward to begin with <space>
<space> towards evening the prince heard a mighty rushing sound in the air and when he looked up <space> he saw thousands of eagles driving the mare before them <space> they sank at his feet <space> on to the ground and gave the mare over to him <space> then the prince rode home to the old mother dragon <space>
<space> she must come and live with me <space> in my palace underground <space> the prince consented to this <space> and led his beautiful bride home <space> where the wedding was held with great <space> pomp <space> and magnificence <space> the young couple lived happily together till <space> winter came <space>
<space> the bird said <space> you are looking for the mother dragon's mare who is galloping <space> about <space> among the clouds <space> i will summon all the eagles of the air together and order them to catch the mare and bring her to you <space> and <space> with these words the king of the eagles flew away <space>
<space> with <space> diamond <space> windows <space> he opened the big <space> gate <space> leading into the <space> courtyard <space>
<space> and determined to lay siege <space> to the flower queen's palace <space> but the queen caused <space> a forest of flowers as high as the sky to grow up <space> round her dwelling <space> through which <space> no one could <space> force <space> a way <space>
<space> and <space> added to it all <space> she had three <space> heads <space> her appearance was <space> a <space> great shock to the prince <space> and so was her voice <space> which was like <space> the croaking <space> of many ravens <space> she asked him <space>
<space> and lasted till the approach of winter <space> when the flower queen's daughter went back again to her mother <space>
<space> would like to enter her service <space> this flattering speech pleased the dragons <space> and the eldest of them said <space> well <space> you may come with me and <space> i will take you to the mother dragon <space>
<space> and again she led him to the ball room <space> the flower queen's daughter was delighted to see him safe and sound <space> and when they were dancing together she whispered in his ear <space> if you succeed again to morrow <space> wait for me <space> with the foal in the meadow <space>
<space> very well <space>
<space> the ball came to an end at midnight <space> and early next morning the prince again led the mother dragon's mare <space> out <space> into the meadow <space> but again she vanished before his eyes <space> then he took out his little bell and rang it twice <space>
<space> the prince and she flew like the wind till they reached the flower queen's dwelling <space> but the dragons had noticed their flight <space> and woke their brother <space> out of his year's sleep <space> he flew into <space> a terrible <space> rage when he heard what had happened <space>
<space> and intended <space> setting <space> out <space> on the following day into the wide world <space> in search of the maid <space> so the next morning the prince mounted his fine horse and left his home <space>
<space> over there <space> at the edge of the forest <space> in the little hut you see in the distance <space> replied the old woman <space> the prince lifted her on to his horse <space> and soon they reached the hut <space> where the old woman got down <space> and turning to the prince said <space>
<space> and his horse had died of exhaustion <space> while he himself had suffered much from want and misery <space> but still he had come <space> on no trace of her <space> he was in search of <space> at last one day he came to a hut <space> in front of which sat a <space> very old man <space>
<space> he asked him the same question and the old man answered <space> no <space>
<space> the prince thanked him for his <space> information <space> and <space> continued his journey for a whole year <space> along the same road <space> and at the end of it <space> came to the little hut where he found a very old man <space>
<space> after the ball <space> we will fly away together <space> on the third day the prince led the mare to the meadow again <space> but once more she vanished before his eyes <space> then the prince took out his little bell and rang it three times <space>
<space> here too was the flower queen's beautiful daughter <space> her dress was woven <space> out of the most lovely flowers in the world <space> and her complexion was like lilies and roses <space> as the prince was dancing with her <space> he managed to <space> whisper in her <space> ear <space>
<space> answered the old woman <space> i am a <space> very poor woman and soon after midnight <space> i set out for the neighbouring town in order to sell my eggs in the market <space> on the following morning <space> but i lost my way in the dark <space>
<space> and taking it out of his pocket <space> he rang it once <space> in a moment he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him <space> and the king of the eagles <space> sank at his feet <space>
<space> to his astonishment he found an old <space> woman who <space> begged him to help her <space> out <space> of <space> the ditch <space> the prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave <space> asking her at the same time how she had managed to get <space> there <space> my son <space>
<space> when the flower queen heard <space> that her daughter wanted to marry the prince <space> she said to him <space> i will give my consent to your marriage gladly <space> but <space> my daughter can <space> only stay with you in summer <space> in winter <space> when everything is dead and the ground covered with snow <space>
<space> no <space> i do not <space> answered the old man <space>
when the flower queen's daughter departed and went home to her mother <space>
<space> we will <space> eat <space> you <space> up <space> the <space> prince undertook the task and led the mare <space> out <space> to the meadow <space>
<space> and at last in despair <space> sat down <space> on a big stone and contemplated his sad fate <space> as he sat thus <space> lost in thought <space> he noticed an eagle flying over his head <space> then he suddenly bethought him <space> of his little bell <space>
<space> which deserves to be rewarded <space> would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife <space> most certainly i would <space> replied the prince <space> so the old woman continued <space>
<space> just wait a moment <space> and i will give you something <space> and she disappeared into her hut <space> but returned very soon and said <space> you <space> are a mighty prince <space> but at the same <space>
<space> the king of the eagles will appear <space> if you ring it twice <space> the king of the foxes will come to you <space> and <space> if you ring it three <space> times <space> you will see the king <space> of the fishes by your side <space>
<space> when seven dragons rushed on him <space> and asked him what he wanted <space> the prince replied <space>
<space> who was full of wonder when she saw him and said <space>
<space> they entered the castle and walked through twelve splendid halls <space> all made of gold and diamonds <space> in the twelfth room <space> they found the mother dragon seated on a diamond <space> throne <space> she was the <space>
<space> she gave him <space> at <space> the same time <space> a cloak made of copper <space>
<space> in a moment <space> the king of the fishes appeared <space> and said to him <space> i know quite <space> well <space> what you <space> want <space> me to do <space> and i will summon <space> all the <space> fishes of the sea together <space>
<space> fairer than a fairy thanked her warmly and resumed her way cheered <space> by pleasant thoughts <space> after a time her road led through a wood full of soft airs and sweet odours <space> and before she had gone a hundred yards <space> she saw <space> a <space> wonderful silver castle <space>
<space> she readily let fairer than a fairy have the fire <space>
<space> and having <space> enforced her orders with the most <space> awful threats <space> in case of disobedience <space> she vanished <space> leaving the little girl at <space> liberty to explore the palace <space>
<space> and <space> eating <space> any <space> young girls <space> our heroine obeyed with great sweetness <space> and without having been able to take leave of her lover <space>
<space> he was just about to present her to his mother and the court <space>
<space> once there lived a king who had no children for many years after his marriage <space> at <space> length heaven granted him a daughter of such remarkable beauty <space> that he could think <space> of no name so appropriate for her <space> as <space> fairer <space> than a fairy <space>
<space> that <space> they wished <space> their houses and garments to be equally alike <space> their occupation consisted in helping those in misfortune <space> and they were as gentle and benevolent <space> as lagree had been cruel and spiteful <space> the third fairy comforted <space> the poor <space> traveller <space>
<space> on opening it <space> found that <space> all the seeds were as many little violins which flew up <space> in the vaulted <space> roof <space> and at once began playing melodiously <space>
<space> she took the bird's advice <space> and in due time arrived at the house of locrinos <space> luckily she only found his wife at home <space> who was much struck by the princess's youth and beauty <space> and sweet gentle manners <space>
<space> who now saw him for the first time <space> in his real shape <space>
<space> she was also so spiteful <space> that she gladly devoted all her time to carrying out <space> all the mean <space> or ill natured <space> tricks <space> of the whole body of fairies <space> with her large experience <space> added to her native spite <space>
<space> she flew at lagree's face and tore out her only eye <space> thus delivering the princess for <space> ever <space> from her persecutor <space>
<space> she <space> felt a little reassured and was further cheered when she discovered that <space> her pet cat <space> and dog <space> had followed her <space>
<space> as to certain death <space> as she was crossing a wood <space> a bird sang to her to pick up a shining pebble <space> which she would <space> find <space> in a fountain close by <space> and to use it when needed <space>
<space> here again she received a present <space> with the same injunctions <space>
<space> fairer than a fairy felt a strong desire to enter this castle <space> but besides being hung <space> a little above the ground <space> there seemed to be neither doors nor windows <space> she had no doubt <space> though <space> really i cannot think why <space>
<space> fairer than a fairy <space> eagerly ran to the window <space> but in her haste <space> she upset the basin and spilt <space> all the water <space> with which she had carefully filled it <space> overnight <space> no other water was at hand <space> except that <space> in the two <space> bottles <space>
<space> she entered a magnificent room which appeared to occupy the entire <space> castle <space> and which was lighted by <space> gold and jewelled stars in the ceiling <space>
<space> and for some time <space> the lovers enjoyed every <space> hour of sunshine together <space> one day prince rainbow appeared in the depths of woe <space> he had <space> just heard that he was to be <space> banished from this lovely spot <space> but he had no idea where he was to go <space>
<space> than they resolved to gain possession of <space> her <space> who bore it <space> and either to torment her cruelly <space> or at least to conceal her from the eyes of all men <space> the eldest of their tribe was entrusted to carry out their revenge <space> this fairy was named <space> lagree <space>
<space> the prince was not completely roused but he opened his eyes a little and looked all the handsomer <space> impatient at not being recognised fairer than a fairy now drew out her third present <space> and on opening the crystal scent bottle <space> a little syren flew out <space>
<space> you ever saw <space> the princess climbed up <space> one of the silver chains <space> holding in her hand the little porter <space> who <space> in spite of his minute size <space> opened a secret door <space> with his golden key and let her in <space>
<space> the rainbow appeared <space> as clearly as it had ever done in the fountain <space> by this means they were able to meet without losing sight of the fire <space> or of the two bottles in which the old fairy kept her eye <space> and her tooth at night <space>
<space> the beautiful <space> rainbow <space> informed fairer than a fairy <space> that he was young <space> the son of a powerful king <space> and that the fairy lagree who <space> owed his <space> parents <space> a grudge <space>
<space> could not help feeling pleased and touched by his attentions <space> the prince could only appear or speak under the form of a rainbow <space> and it was therefore necessary that the sun should shine on water <space> so as to enable the rays <space> to form themselves <space>
<space> but no sooner had lagree <space> been put <space> to fight than <space> our <space> heroine was overwhelmed with hunger and thirst <space> she felt <space> as though she should certainly expire and it was with some difficulty that she dragged herself as far <space>
<space> she was so old <space> that she only had one eye <space> and one tooth left <space>
<space> the prince made the most <space> ardent and sincere protestations <space> and promised to neglect nothing which might help to deliver his dear fairer than a fairy <space> from her captivity <space> and implored her to consent to their marriage as soon as they should both <space> be free <space>
<space> she gave her a nut <space> desiring her <space> only to open it <space> in the most <space> urgent need <space> after a long and tiring journey <space> fairer than a fairy was once more received in a house <space> and by a lady exactly like the one she <space>
<space> had revenged herself by depriving him <space> of his natural shape for some years <space> that she had imprisoned him in the palace <space> where he had found his confinement <space> hard to bear for some time <space> but now he owned <space>
<space> in the first and most <space> splendid of these carriages <space> sat <space> prince rainbow's <space> mother <space> she fondly embraced her son <space> after which she informed him <space> that his father had been dead for some years <space> that the anger of the fairies was at <space> length <space> appeased <space>
<space> for fire <space> with which to relight <space> the one she had allowed to <space> go out <space> now this <space> locrinos <space> was a cruel monster <space> who devoured <space> everyone he came across <space> and especially enjoyed a chance of catching <space>
<space> as she did so the sprig of myrtle she carried <space> touched the ground and immediately <space> a green <space> and shady bower sprang up <space> round her <space> in which she hoped to sleep <space> in peace <space> but <space> lagree had not given up her pursuit <space>
<space> and that he might return <space> in peace to reign over his people <space> who were longing for his presence <space> the court received the new king with joyful acclamations <space> which would have delighted him at any other time <space>
<space> at <space> the same moment <space> the walls <space> of the room expanded and opened out <space> revealing a <space> golden throne <space> covered with jewels <space>
<space> and arrived just <space> as fairer than a fairy had <space> fallen fast asleep <space> this time she made sure of catching her victim <space> but the cat spied her out <space>
<space> she noticed that the sun's rays fell on the water in such a manner as to produce a <space> brilliant <space> rainbow <space> she stood still to admire it <space> when <space> to her great surprise <space> she heard a voice addressing her <space> which seemed to <space> come from the centre of its rays <space>
<space> the poor young couple were in despair <space> and only parted with <space> the last ray of sunshine <space> and in hopes of meeting next morning <space> alas <space> next day was dark and gloomy <space> and it was only late <space> in the afternoon that the sun broke through the clouds for a few minutes <space>
<space> it was the only chance of seeing her lover <space> before they were separated <space> and she did not hesitate to <space> break the bottle <space> and pour their contents <space> into the basin <space> when the rainbow appeared at once <space> their farewells were full of tenderness <space>
<space> he no longer sighed for freedom since he had seen and learned to love fairer than a fairy <space> he added many other tender speeches to this declaration and the princess to whom such remarks were a new experience <space>
<space> the voice <space> was that of a young man <space> and its sweetness of tone <space> and the agreeable things it <space> uttered <space> led one to infer <space> that its <space> owner must <space> be equally charming <space> but this had to be a mere matter of fancy <space> for no one was visible <space>
<space> that the moment had come <space> in which to use the nut <space> which had been given her <space> she opened it <space> and out came <space> a diminutive hall <space> porter <space>
<space> begged her not to lose heart <space> and assured her <space> that her troubles <space> should be rewarded <space> she accompanied her advice <space> by the gift <space> of a crystal smelling bottle <space> with strict orders <space> only to open it <space> in case <space> of urgent need <space>
<space> at the same time giving her the strictest orders <space> never to let out <space> the fire which was burning brightly in the grate <space> she then gave two <space> glass bottles <space> into the princess's charge <space> desiring her to take the greatest care of them <space>
<space> charms would win all hearts <space> when the three green and white sisters appeared <space> they declared the secret of fairy than a fairy's royal birth <space> and the queen taking the two lovers in her carriage <space> set off with them <space> for the capital of the kingdom <space>
<space> the princess on her side vowed to have no other husband <space> and declared herself <space> willing to <space> brave death itself <space> in order to rejoin him <space> they were not allowed much time for their adieus <space> the rainbow vanished <space> and the princess <space> resolved to run all risks <space>
<space> several years passed during which time the princess grew accustomed to her lonely life <space> obeyed the fairy's orders <space> and by degrees <space> forgot <space> all about the court of the king <space> her father <space>
<space> lagree <space> on her return <space> soon found out the neglect <space> and seemed <space> only too <space> pleased to have the opportunity <space> of showing her spite to her lovely prisoner <space>
<space> convenient way of meeting than by the garden fountain <space> and fairer than a fairy carried out his plan daily <space> with entire success <space> every morning she placed a large basin full of water on her window sill <space> and as soon as the sun's rays fell <space> on the water <space>
<space> started off at once taking nothing with her <space> but her <space> dog <space> her cat <space> a sprig of myrtle <space> and the stone which the wife of <space> locrinos gave her <space> when lagree became aware <space> of her <space> prisoner's <space> flight <space>
<space> which stood <space> at no great distance <space> here she was received <space> by a beautiful lady dressed in green and white <space> to match the house <space> which apparently belonged to her <space> and of which she seemed <space> the only inhabitant <space>
<space> at <space> the water which <space> lies far out <space> yonder and the plains which stretch beyond <space>
<space> only the children had no fear <space> and reached the other side in safety <space> still <space> though the chief and the young girl quailed in terror at these <space> horrible sights and sounds <space> no harm came to them <space> for their lives had been free from evil <space>
<space> instead of hiding as he approached <space> and birds circled round him <space>
<space> far away <space> in north america <space> where the red indians dwell <space>
<space> so the next morning he got up early <space> and put some food in his pouch <space> and slung an extra skin over his shoulders <space> for he knew not how long his journey would take <space> nor what sort of country he would have to go through <space> only one thing he knew <space>
<space> but from sunrise to sunset <space> he sat by the place where she was laid <space> thinking <space> of his happiness that was buried <space> there <space> at last after many days <space> a light seemed to come to him <space> out of <space> the darkness <space>
<space> but grew less and less the farther he went south <space> till it disappeared altogether <space> soon the trees put forth their buds and flowers sprang up under his feet <space> and instead of thick clouds <space> there was <space> blue sky over his head <space> and <space> everywhere the <space> birds were singing <space>
<space> he remembered having heard <space> from the <space> old <space> old <space> people of <space> the tribe <space> that there was a path <space> that led <space> to the land of souls <space> that if you sought carefully <space> you could find <space> it <space>
<space> but <space> in the murmur of the wind <space> he heard the master of life saying to him <space> return whither you <space> came <space> for i have <space> work for you to do <space> and your people need you <space> and for many years you shall <space> rule over them <space>
<space> and on the top of these <space> he found a hut <space> or <space> wigwam <space> an old man <space> clothed in skins <space> and holding a staff in his hand <space> stood in the doorway <space>
<space> but no man enters it <space> without <space> leaving his body behind him <space>
<space> rest in my <space> hut as she also rested <space> and i will tell you what you ask <space> and whither you should go <space> on hearing these words <space> the young man entered the hut <space> but his heart was too eager within him <space>
<space> so they reached <space> unhurt the shore <space> of the happy island <space> and wandered through the <space> flowery fields <space> and by the banks of rushing streams <space> and they knew not hunger <space> nor thirst <space> neither cold nor heat <space>
<space> at the gate <space> my messenger awaits you <space> and you shall take again <space>
<space> many of the young braves sought her in marriage <space> but she would listen to one only <space> a handsome chief <space> who had taken her fancy some years before <space> so they were to be married <space> and great rejoicings were made <space>
<space> one of the old men say <space> that the land of souls lay to the south <space> and so filled with <space> new hope and courage <space> he set his face southwards <space> for many many miles the country looked <space> the same as it did round his own home <space>
<space> very soon he noticed with wonder <space> that neither rocks <space> nor trees barred his path <space> he passed through them without knowing it <space> for indeed <space> they were not rocks and trees at all <space> but only the souls of <space> them <space> for this <space> was the land of shadows <space>
<space> to suffer him to rest <space> and when he arose <space> the old man rose too <space> and stood with him at the door <space> look <space> he said <space>
when to his joy and wonder <space> he saw following him in another canoe exactly like his own <space> the maiden for whose sake he had made <space> this long journey <space> but they could not touch each other <space> for between them <space> rolled great waves <space> which looked as if they would sink the boats <space>
<space> she asked him how he came and what was his business there <space> he told her all that happened <space> and because she was pleased with him she took compassion on him <space>
<space> and they journeyed on <space> with their little whip <space> they had as much money as they wanted <space> wore grand clothes <space> and made their way into the world <space> wherever they went <space> they lived in merrymaking and splendour <space> drove about with horses and carriages <space> ate <space> and drank <space> but did nothing wrong <space>
<space> said they <space> then the dragon seized them in his claws <space> took them through the air over the army <space> and set them down on the earth <space> a long way from it <space> he gave them a little whip saying <space>
<space> i will tell you this <space> in the north sea lies a dead sea cat <space> that shall be their roast meat <space> and the rib of a whale <space> that <space> shall be their silver spoon <space> and the hollow foot of a dead horse <space> that shall be their wineglass <space>
<space> do you know what your wineglass shall be <space> an old horse's hoof shall be our wineglass <space>
<space> the dragon made a face and <space> growled again three times <space> hum <space>
<space> that won't save us <space> and they remained where they were <space> but the third and merry one <space> jumped up <space> and went <space> into the wood <space> till he found <space> the rock hut <space> in the hut <space> sat a very old woman <space> who was the dragon's grandmother <space>
<space> one of them said to the others <space> if we are caught <space> we shall be hanged on the gallows <space> how shall we set about it <space> the other said <space> do you see that large cornfield there <space>
<space> pointing at the signatures said <space> i will take you underground with me <space> you shall have a meal there <space> if you can tell me what <space> you will get for your roast meat <space> you shall be free <space>
<space> and how he had given them money as <space> plentifully as blackberries <space> but as they had signed their names <space> they were his <space> unless <space> when the seven years had passed they could guess a <space> riddle <space> the old woman said <space>
<space> then he put a book <space> before them <space> which he made all three of them sign <space> i will then give you a riddle <space> he said <space> if you guess it <space> you shall be free and <space> out of my power <space> the dragon then flew away <space>
<space> they sat for two days <space> and two nights <space> in the corn <space> and grew so hungry that they nearly died <space> but if they were to venture out <space> it was certain death <space> they said at last <space>
<space> if you would help yourselves <space> one <space> of you must go into the wood <space> and <space> there he will come upon a tumble down building of <space> rocks <space> which looks like a little house <space> he must go in <space> and <space> there he will find help <space> the two melancholy ones thought <space>
<space> what use was it our deserting <space> we must perish here miserably <space> whilst they were speaking <space> a fiery <space> dragon came flying through the air <space>
<space> they went into a field sat down <space> and the two pulled long faces <space> an old woman passed by and asked them why they were so sad <space>
<space> then said the first soldier <space>
<space> i <space> know enough <space> and can help myself splendidly <space> then he went by another way through the window secretly <space> and in all haste back to his comrades <space> he told them how the dragon had been <space> outwitted <space> by his grandmother <space>
<space> if we were to hide ourselves in that <space> no one could find us <space> the army cannot come into it <space> and to morrow <space> it is to march on <space> they crept into the corn <space> but the army did not march on <space> but remained encamped close around them <space>
<space> and how he had heard from his own lips the answer to the riddle <space> then they were all delighted <space> and in high spirits <space> took out their whip <space> and cracked so much money <space> that it came jumping up from the ground <space> when the seven years had quite gone <space> the fiend came with his book <space> and <space>
<space> only confide your trouble in me <space>
<space> but it would have broken down after ten miles of that hard trail <space> dawn came while they wound over the crest of the range <space> and with the sun in their faces they took the downgrade <space> it was well into the morning before nash reached logan <space>
<space> but he didn't see none <space> then the circus started <space> an b'lieve me <space> it was some circus <space> jo hadn't had much action for some time <space>
<space> unsaddled him <space> and gave him a small feed <space> the horse <space> first rolled on the dirt floor <space> and then started methodically on his fodder <space> having made sure that his mount was not off his feed <space> nash rolled a cigarette <space> and strolled back to the house with the boy <space>
